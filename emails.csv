The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest	evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,	which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his	supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.	Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met	the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his	appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.	The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to	destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded	with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.	Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has	ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who	have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new	archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the	church.	judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the	common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.	""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan	Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand	down,"" it said.	The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on	bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of	which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from	Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be	""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".	It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal	called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles	allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.	Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the	church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown	appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his	appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.	He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be	formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.	Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the	small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking	alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams	is present.	Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down	during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the	evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the	absence of a robust rebuttal.	A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the	evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical	teaching.	On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of	Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption	and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is	attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get	your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.	Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality	should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church	Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his	appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take	the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

Filmmakers 	    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 	    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 	    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 	    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 	    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 	    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 	    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 	    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 	    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 	    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 	    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 	    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 	    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 	    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 	    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 	    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films.

It did not.	The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square	meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's	informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go	as high as US$3,000.	I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't	correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,	in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise	participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.	French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)	The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,	which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if	in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and	conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate	of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the	whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly	paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was	not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent	country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...	between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence	under Lorenzo the Magnificent?	De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those	who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do	not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they	don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital	and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged	with a small section of people who know them personally.

Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.	Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 	GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 	warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 	a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 	primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 	air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 	restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 	shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 	some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 	and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.	It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 	don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 	shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 	you don't like its content.

I actually lived on	a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest	and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my	parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than	I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I	do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand	from my father.	The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because	it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it	is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a	consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not	something that was impressed upon them.	The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity	that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian	Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a	single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from	tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the	tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per	person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of	places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various	businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.	are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their	share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very	high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy	take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the	corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting	purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one	works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those	dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because	they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is	that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,	many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white	folk, not Indians.	Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also	receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation	to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By	benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other	ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.	It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are	ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are	very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good	credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the	Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has	billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have	gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the	dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular	case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before	drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to	intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have	actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,	there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50	million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal	government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This	particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures	per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many	borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,	the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand	dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather	than their own pockets.	Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable	assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given	where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign	companies.  And the cycle continues.	So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a	nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.	Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and	gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during	pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very	substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of	the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the	earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one	these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is	arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police	etc).	In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a	shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I	have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't	that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I	could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless	you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but	it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good	guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,	if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as	a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are	openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It	will give you an interesting perspective on things.)	There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous	Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and	intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is	where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if	they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal	leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological	cases mentioned above.	The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent	by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high	when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is	just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to	ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The	poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my	original point.	One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal	corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate	socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this	structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has	interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well	over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.	It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly	voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western	society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with	the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting	individuals.	Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com "

The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed	Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion	after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.	The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)	south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.	It had not eaten for three weeks.	Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in	the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the	monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.	Garlanded	One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had	failed because of the blind faith of the people.	The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal	out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.	The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month	ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,	as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.	Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it	around the clock.	'Exploited'	Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as	the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of	residents.	But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being	mistreated.	They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been	forcibly confined in the temple.	The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being	exploited to make money.	The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but	villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time."

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,	and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,	SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then	spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 	access with postgreSQL).	This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 	framework for other web applications.	The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.	I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 	database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.	Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.	A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 	encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 	and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 	I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 	database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 	Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 	database password, I can use a different database with different 	user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.	Where I can found good documentation about this topic?	There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 	thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 	After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 	learn methods and technics.	First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 	I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 	could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 	(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 	nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 	or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.	The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 	the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 	bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 	is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 	db connection/password to the main web application.	In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 	shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 	account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 	provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 	application (that means, really, another server running in the 	background).	Any suggestions?	Thank you,	Mario Torre	Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments."

Owen	Internet can level the political playing field	By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro	NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 	of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 	malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 	stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 	public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 	personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 	ask for our votes.	Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 	has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.	In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 	Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 	addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 	each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.	That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 	expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 	spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 	35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.	Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 	been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 	would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 	through any of those channels.	The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 	was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 	entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 	refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 	``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.	His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 	because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 	may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 	in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 	mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.	No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 	highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 	it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 	unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.	The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 	that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 	believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 	TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 	simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 	future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 	taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.	When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 	Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 	to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 	percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 	accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.	Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 	Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 	ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 	groups.	But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 	an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 	opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 	the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 	advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 	Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 	they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.	Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 	advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 	the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 	founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 	for the Los Angeles Times. "

Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented	towards people with experience in Java/XML development.	There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available	in the next release.	- Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using	digital signatures within a hierarchy.	- Storage framework for ""Named Objects"".	- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet	interoperable with other implementations)	- Simple SOAP client	- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named	  Objects"".

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 	access with postgreSQL).	This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 	framework for other web applications.	The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.	I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 	database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.	Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.	A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 	encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 	and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 	I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 	database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 	Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 	database password, I can use a different database with different 	user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.	Where I can found good documentation about this topic?	There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 	thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 	After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 	learn methods and technics.	First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 	I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 	could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 	(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 	nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 	or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.	The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 	the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 	bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 	is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 	db connection/password to the main web application.	In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 	shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 	account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 	provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 	application (that means, really, another server running in the 	background).	Any suggestions?	Thank you,	Mario Torre	Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments."

Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 	Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 	it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy.

Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA	then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5	would be sufficient.	If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.	Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once	for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor	won't do it and avoid the double network hit.	However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has	been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The	current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.	But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.

There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at	""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain	a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in	their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse	engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular	that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third	party or otherwise) was in development.	All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the	private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have	updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have	resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first	place.	But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly	exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.	But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of	""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it	is not allowed to load.	It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants	""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands	something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform	vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In	Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to	make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public	APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the	number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if	third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the	desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be	prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.	But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer	effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to	provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """

With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.	But there was something else.

The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of	modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right	geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed	along its top.	The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the	curvature of the Earth.	It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12	large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was	published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of	Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the	world.

The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 	    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 	    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 	    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 	    international shipping duties on the computers.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed	last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh	come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it	ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story	lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the	enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to	have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.	But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would	rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign	on the old killsawfiles.	SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say	that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,	thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too	long and just when things look to be heating up with that story	arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces	that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the	Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie	McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first	lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.	Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this	around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier	way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be	edited much though from the way I heard it.	So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play	acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a	face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,	thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat	and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some	heat time would be good for him as a single.	All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4	year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on	borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no	longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?	Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz	and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.	* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.

Can you say	""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...	[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,	like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught	you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of	*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get	around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing	transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's	government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of	innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this	summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out	there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]	The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a	""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the	best school possible.	Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,	for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,	ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the	years for proof.	Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after	World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,	Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who	goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually	afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who	couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the	last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,	and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.	The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""	degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or	learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss	basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after	death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people	who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*	smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.	BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this	rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to	beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You	were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to	Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,	much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on	this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with	educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The	facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.	There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and	economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including	ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,	intelligence and effort.	[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of	competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,	apparently.]	BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,	*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,	all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and	there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,	most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have	*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically	all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and	not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.	That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The	People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better	stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept	apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd	know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase	in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about	extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who	doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some	politician as Santa Claus come election time...	In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not	theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and	redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just	To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx	wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good	condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.	They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple	about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.

Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby	town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the	temple to take care of them.

The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on	senses other than sight.	Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland	Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been	blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery	and drinks.	""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't	find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish	is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.	In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose	complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like	a fish, meat or vegetarian option.	""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and	smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and	sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.	""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over	and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he	added.	Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.	An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to	help, Scharnbach said.	And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have	actually been eating."

Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush	folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is	this again?	Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.	Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to	be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few	years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have	changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).

If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably	assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?	Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this	scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I	falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.	End of story.	I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to	chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting	down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a	span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the	rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you	question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in	general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of	the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an	anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles	away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.	I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats	speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting	over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other	way.	Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to	an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How	do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience	without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was	throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause	physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.	California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that	has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has	the option to leave.

Greg	Reuters Market News	  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 	  By Peter Henderson 	  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday	  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as	  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.	  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld	  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals	  making computers which manage networks. 	  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage	  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for	  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working	  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.	  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the	  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box	  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an	  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 	  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or	  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever	  needed. 	  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling	  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are	  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from	  different vendors to interoperate closely. 	  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at	  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today	  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 	  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay	  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as	  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 	  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on	  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response	  time for priority users, the company said."

This 	excerpt was rather amusing.	browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 	browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 	window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 	Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 	MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 	Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 	[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 	fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 	Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 	""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 	browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 	because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 	Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 	downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 	was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 	browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 	browser that embedded WinIE. 	MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 	prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 	a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 	context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 	definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 	capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 	the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 	I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 	weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 	encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 	would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 	single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.	The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 	much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 	overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 	Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 	browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 	didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 	nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 	continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 	that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 	of it.	Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 	Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 	now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 	twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 	Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 	should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 	off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 	Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic."

In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...	menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 	.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 	you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 	for this).	However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 	the existing Sedit window prior to composition.	I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.	Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 	exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 	script as your signature.	I hope this helps some.

Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold	winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been	detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.	""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said	Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London	who discovered the creatures in the UK.	The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous	damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,	otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known	north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely	these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental	plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""	He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store	in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a	migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in	south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has	established itself firmly in the same area.	Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and	grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The	soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.	One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of	Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a	fact.	Sell a Home with Ease!	forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com"

According to scuttlebutt that	emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,	Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President	Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,	the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the	French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't	have a word for entrepreneur.""	The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness	Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had	recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.	Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness	Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did	receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of	communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime	minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly	never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""	Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must	have been a joke.""	This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of	a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than	stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories	too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've	chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the	moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the	ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged	as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the	intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus	quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win	the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it	was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks	to chortling up their sleeves.	Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual	shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they	seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this	public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever	been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at	some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always	fall upon appreciative ears.	Barbara ""ears of corn"" Mikkelson"

As usual the result is	that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually	testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality	people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from	that, right? ;-)	I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages	should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and	maybe others, who knows ;-)	Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :	- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel	  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)	- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package	- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package	- Install the ""alsa-utils"" package	Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your	/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :	(very complete and very good documentation!)	Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)	Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need	to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and	insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to	check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with	e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.	With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You	can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...	hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3	files... that's it!	It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only	thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't	imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the	/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly	%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d	structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the	default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's	development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static	libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against	which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the	rpm release, so does the architecture!).	I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!	Download :	Current spec files :	Matthias	run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)	Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10"

For processes that are running	months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing	lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure	every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers	to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a	design/programming issue.	That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then	re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a	language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 	The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly	detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around	bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give	you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of	a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune	(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 	Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you	could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by	raw performance scalability.	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com"

Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)	Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need	to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and	insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to	check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with	e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.	With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You	can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...	hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3	files... that's it!	It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only	thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't	imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the	/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly	%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d	structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the	default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's	development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static	libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against	which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the	rpm release, so does the architecture!).	I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!	Download :	Current spec files :	Matthias	run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go!

Some of this has to	do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I	was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting	something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over	several distinct issues.	The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse	that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their	interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in	Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to	Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token	representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on	exactly how the government works up there, representation is not	entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern	provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have	substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire	province of Alberta.  	The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta	as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so	much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the	sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having	fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less	restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like	having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,	Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is	essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the	inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of	Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax	dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.	I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally	clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial	unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little	fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the	Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and	the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

513,ham,"	by jmason.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id 38FFB16F03		by localhost with IMAP (fetchmail-5.9.0)	    id g8A5x5C19356		version=2.50-cvs	Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to	just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!	This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!	However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only	the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing	1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the	   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is	   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would	   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.	   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics	   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,	   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and	1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'	    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll	    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.	1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)	    in BIOS, please.	2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan	   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off	   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good	  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an	  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)	     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs	  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display	  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion	  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)	      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative	  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle	  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally	  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them	  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides	  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little	  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep	  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 	3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the	    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to	    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but	    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified	   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the	   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with	   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides	   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted	   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.	     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,	   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see	   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great	   candidates) base.  	      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight	    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-	    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare	    hood) to feed	    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 	    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.	      The logo should be a coloration of a	   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew	   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and	   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the	   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the	   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.	   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.	4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.	USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.	Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port	should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 	.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more	reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,	and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.	CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card	interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to	USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.	To that end, a backup solution with compression using	USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 	bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....	Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 	Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.	Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,	builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 	and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that	says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 	Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 	an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 	keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.	2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 	18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our	(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.	Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 	fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade	Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling	and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user	seat and provide mineral water.

I say 	half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 	keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 	on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 	personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 	towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 	I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 	common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 	home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 	but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 	""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 	various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 	with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 	to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 	(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 	first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 	""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 	submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 	""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 	larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 	WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 	Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 	On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 	the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 	fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 	new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 	compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 	open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 	(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 	I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 	collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 	cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 	bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 	also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 	120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 	3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 	window. 	with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 	cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 	weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 	background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 	unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 	me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 	from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 	In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 	that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 	Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 	since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 	pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 	I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 	so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 	foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 	is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 	sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 	scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 	for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 	name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 	yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 	I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 	all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 	I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 	projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 	temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 	created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 	I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 	addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 	any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 	lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 	after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 	my single most backed-up possession. 	Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI	[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].	     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32"

562,ham,"My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals	very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.	If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to	press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy	to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition	have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look	much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup	the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.	The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete	action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems	without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of	habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,	I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.	I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.	The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,	and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one	in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we	need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see	how similar they are.  Any ideas ?	Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.	If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),	false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite	to remove the spam smell.	In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much	smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be	slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from	the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.	Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,	there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,	and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,	that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.	It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from	the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.		/Paul"

When	the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will	be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.	ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a	training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.	Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the	Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish	universities.	The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme	that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source	style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational	channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software	with its operating environment and offering networked support	services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed	to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to	schools and universities throughout the world.	Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance	features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to	master on personal systems.	The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red	Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial	services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now	its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,	although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in	Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.	David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,	sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take	a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his	office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish	companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced	some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.	Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.	Regards	L."

It did not.	The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square	meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's	informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go	as high as US$3,000.	I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't	correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,	in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise	participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.	French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)	The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,	which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if	in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and	conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate	of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the	whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly	paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was	not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent	country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...	between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence	under Lorenzo the Magnificent?	De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those	who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do	not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they	don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital	and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged	with a small section of people who know them personally.

Geege	-----Original Message-----	Settlement List	/s/United States/Roman Empire/g))	-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----	Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's	composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to	get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say	""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...	[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,	like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught	you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of	*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get	around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing	transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's	government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of	innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this	summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out	there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]	The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a	""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the	best school possible.	Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,	for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,	ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the	years for proof.	Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after	World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,	Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who	goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually	afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who	couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the	last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,	and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.	The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""	degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or	learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss	basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after	death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people	who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*	smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.	BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this	rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to	beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You	were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to	Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,	much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on	this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with	educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The	facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.	There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and	economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including	ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,	intelligence and effort.	[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of	competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,	apparently.]	BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,	*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,	all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and	there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,	most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have	*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically	all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and	not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.	That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The	People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better	stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept	apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd	know about it by now.

At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to	think that some the participants may have actually slowed 	their pace a bit. 	So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 	easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study	will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 	sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution	could easily be in the 3000+ range.	Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 	population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence	of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 	that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so	people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it	were sheer fantasy.

It's #1 in 	practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 	Amman.

It would be a powerful education on 	how engaged we are in the world around us.	Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 	globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 	stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 	the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.

Rohit	September 20, 2002	Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 	strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 	United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 	the Administration's policy.	INTRODUCTION	THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 	totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 	democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 	nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 	guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 	potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 	everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 	worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 	property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 	are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 	protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 	freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.	Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 	strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 	heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 	unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 	can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 	economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 	world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 	against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 	by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 	peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.	Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 	commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 	dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 	industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 	individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 	than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 	penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 	against us.	To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 	from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 	cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 	reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 	nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 	hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 	allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 	countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 	new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 	turn.	The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 	and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 	weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 	so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 	succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 	means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 	contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 	technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 	will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 	cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 	be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 	and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 	saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 	entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.	As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 	opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 	has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 	seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 	instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 	find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 	violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 	interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 	common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 	for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 	leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 	national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 	freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 	the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 	because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 	international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 	powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 	trade, and cultural advancement.	Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 	the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 	the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 	every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 	that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 	national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 	into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 	corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 	drug cartels within their borders.	The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 	better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 	trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 	out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 	nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 	build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 	The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 	the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 	invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 	continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 	AIDS and other infectious diseases.	In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 	guided by the conviction that all nations have important 	responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 	Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 	spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 	aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 	freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.	We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 	better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 	the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 	to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 	Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 	other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 	these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 	are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 	rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.	Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 	every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 	been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 	clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 	it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 	holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 	these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 	this great mission.	I. Overview of America's International Strategy	""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 	fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 	liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 	and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 	the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 	open societies on every continent.""	President Bush	West Point, New York	June 1, 2002	The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 	and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 	liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 	unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 	strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 	favors freedom.	For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 	equality.	That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 	race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 	discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 	are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 	catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 	defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.	This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 	translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 	and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 	distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 	values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 	make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 	with other states, and respect for human dignity.	And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.	*	champion aspirations for human dignity;	*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 	attacks against us and our friends;	*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;	*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 	friends, with weapons of mass destruction;	*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 	free trade;	*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 	the infrastructure of democracy;	*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 	global power; and	*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 	challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.	II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity	""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 	language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 	different methods, but not different moralities.""	President Bush	West Point, New York	June 1, 2002	In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 	these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 	owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 	mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 	free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 	oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 	the secret police.	America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 	free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 	religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.	These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 	us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 	facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 	core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 	been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 	aspirations of their people.	Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 	our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 	Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 	stronger, but is a freer and more just society.	Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 	when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 	and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 	we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 	the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 	America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 	evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 	cherish.	Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 	the national security strategy of the United States must start from 	these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.	Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 	cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 	of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 	bodies.	*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 	human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 	advance freedom;	*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 	struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 	democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;	*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 	themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 	from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 	to move toward a better future; and	*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 	and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.	We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 	it.	III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 	Attacks Against Us and Our Friends	""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 	the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 	waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 	peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 	the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 	our choosing.""	President Bush	Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)	September 14, 2001	The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 	global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 	religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 	politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.	In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 	lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 	within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 	States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 	with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 	knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.	The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 	our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 	elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 	through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 	unseen.	Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 	and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 	achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 	forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 	only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 	trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 	America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.	Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 	organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 	control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 	have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.	We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 	coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 	campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 	the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 	tools necessary to finish the task.	The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 	financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 	funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 	support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 	system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 	and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 	financial networks.	However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 	cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 	seek.	*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 	international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 	organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 	terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 	(WMD) or their precursors;	*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 	at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 	reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 	enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 	to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 	acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 	harm against our people and our country; and	*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 	by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 	responsibilities.	We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 	*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 	with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 	illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 	can condone or support and all must oppose;	*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 	world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 	terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;	*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 	enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 	on areas most at risk; and	*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 	information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 	those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.	While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 	strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 	attack.	This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 	since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 	and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 	Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 	reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 	encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 	and the private sector.	This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 	emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 	terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 	to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 	mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 	terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.	While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 	in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 	Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 	and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 	governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 	will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 	our allies can provide.	As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 	with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 	non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 	humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 	rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 	threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists	In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 	ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 	and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 	conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 	productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 	ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.	IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts	""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 	The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 	look so small.""	President Bush	Berlin, Germany	May 23, 2002	Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 	disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 	an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 	alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 	horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 	falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 	alleviate suffering and restore stability.	No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 	direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 	and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 	*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 	international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 	crises when they emerge.	*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 	those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 	people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.	Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 	The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 	human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 	of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 	to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 	for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 	to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 	peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 	government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 	counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 	parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 	comprehensive settlement to the conflict.	The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 	stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 	development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 	establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 	Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 	corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 	for the creation of a Palestinian state.	Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 	Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 	United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 	steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 	As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 	fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 	with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 	activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 	freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 	to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 	role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 	Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.	In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 	and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 	time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 	Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 	constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 	Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 	choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 	open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 	become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 	and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 	involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 	bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 	that can help defuse military confrontation.	Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 	respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 	the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 	employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 	neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 	Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.	In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 	countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 	Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 	hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 	opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 	the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 	(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 	the entire hemisphere.	Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 	from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 	and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 	security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 	strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 	their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 	drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 	in our own country.	In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 	groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 	activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 	working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 	illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 	sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 	security to the Colombian people.	In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 	and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 	States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 	combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 	African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 	Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 	fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 	borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 	infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.	An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 	spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 	of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 	confronting these emerging transnational threats.	Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 	focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 	administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 	*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 	Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 	and require focused attention;	*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 	essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 	operations; and	*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 	must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 	threats on a sustained basis.	Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 	surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 	conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 	waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 	the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 	common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 	opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.	V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 	with Weapons of Mass Destruction	""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 	technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 	weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 	even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 	strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 	have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 	capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 	we will oppose them with all our power.""	President Bush	West Point, New York	June 1, 2002	The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 	allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 	force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 	collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 	environment has undergone profound transformation.	Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 	balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 	arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 	counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 	inconceivable.	But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 	None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 	that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 	motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 	destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 	states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 	destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 	and dangerous.	In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 	states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 	*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 	for the personal gain of the rulers;	*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 	and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;	*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 	other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 	to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;	*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and	*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 	for which it stands.	At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 	designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 	Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 	weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 	the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 	increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 	Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 	well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 	become a looming threat to all nations.	We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 	before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 	against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 	take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 	partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 	forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 	missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 	collection and analysis.	*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 	against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 	capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 	capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 	homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 	into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 	our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 	adversaries.	*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 	terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 	necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 	arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 	assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 	necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 	continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 	increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 	threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 	billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 	forward.	*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 	use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 	WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 	weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 	enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 	must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 	forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.	It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 	this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 	United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 	in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 	of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 	caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 	We cannot let our enemies strike first.	*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 	faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 	effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 	retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 	more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 	the wealth of their nations.	*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 	weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 	used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 	of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 	military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 	allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 	allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 	of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 	of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.	*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 	terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 	targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 	and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 	states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 	action.	For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 	an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 	against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 	and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 	on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 	mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.	We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 	objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 	seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 	fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 	of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 	and delivered covertly and without warning.	The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 	population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 	of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 	mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 	these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 	and used weapons of mass destruction.	The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 	to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 	threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 	the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 	uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 	forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 	States will, if necessary, act preemptively.	The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 	threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 	Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 	the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 	remain idle while dangers gather.	We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 	*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 	timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;	*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 	most dangerous threats; and	*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 	conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.	The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 	to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 	actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.	VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 	Free Trade.	""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 	privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 	enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 	better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 	revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""	President Bush	Monterrey, Mexico	March 22, 2002	A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 	prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 	supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 	incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 	economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 	reinforces the habits of liberty.	We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 	shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 	policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 	economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 	policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 	*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 	investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;	*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 	improve incentives for work and investment;	*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 	confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 	endeavors;	*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 	efficient use;	*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;	*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 	skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and	*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 	diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 	opportunity.	command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 	best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 	strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 	all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 	developing world.	A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 	national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 	for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 	of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 	their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 	Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 	non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 	use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 	including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 	are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 	global economic growth.	Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 	growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 	the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 	markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 	living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 	world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 	allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 	their future.	We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 	access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 	continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 	markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 	Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 	Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 	more effectively resolving them when they occur.	The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 	occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 	so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 	conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 	achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 	exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.	The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 	became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 	value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 	that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 	freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 	*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 	helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 	especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 	completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 	accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 	Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.	*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 	in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 	the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 	States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 	targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 	government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 	poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 	allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 	trade.	*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 	free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 	will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 	Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 	developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 	Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 	be our principal focal points.	*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 	administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 	Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 	majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 	Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 	developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 	work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 	agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 	Promotion Authority.	*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 	policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 	competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 	societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 	integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 	developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 	Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 	produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 	use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 	to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 	countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 	the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 	health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 	flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 	medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 	malaria.	*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 	Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 	enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 	disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 	global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 	that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 	against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 	community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 	subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 	undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.	*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 	statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 	in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 	American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 	enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 	the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 	workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 	change and dynamism of open markets.	*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 	economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 	widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 	concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 	between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 	International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 	talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.	*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 	and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 	allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 	types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 	Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 	work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 	technologies.	Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 	greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 	them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 	global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 	gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 	emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 	years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 	*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 	international cooperation;	*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 	the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 	companies that can show real cuts;	*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 	reductions;	*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 	well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 	while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;	*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 	a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 	by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 	budget; and	*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 	emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 	resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 	better path.	VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 	the Infrastructure of Democracy	""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 	rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 	must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""	President Bush	Washington, D.C. (Inter-American	Development Bank)	March 14, 2002	A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 	race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 	all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 	opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 	U.S. international policy.	Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 	growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 	to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 	perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 	spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 	achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.	Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 	failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 	for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 	the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.	This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 	of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 	impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 	implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 	of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 	poorest economies within a decade.	The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 	*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 	national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 	development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 	present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 	these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 	Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 	in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 	corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 	in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 	enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 	countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 	that have not to implement reforms.	*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 	banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 	comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 	multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 	the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 	contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 	contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 	World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 	Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 	poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 	in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 	development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 	productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 	and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 	must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 	developing countries.	*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 	assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 	poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 	more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 	health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 	better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 	the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 	results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 	development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 	development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 	achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 	replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 	system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 	donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 	achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 	contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 	World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 	progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 	that these institutions do.	*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 	the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 	is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 	particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 	ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 	agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 	poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 	sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 	by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 	banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 	sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 	development projects that show results.	*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 	the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 	most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 	foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 	as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 	security strategy.	*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 	countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 	like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 	threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 	developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 	governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 	local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 	global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 	and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 	treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 	twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 	global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.	*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 	democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 	are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 	will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 	percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 	training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 	technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 	devastated by AIDS.	*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 	including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 	in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 	Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 	to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 	suffer from hunger and malnutrition.	VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 	of Global Power	""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 	century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 	of prepare for war.""	President Bush	West Point, New York	June 1, 2002	America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 	broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 	of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 	clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 	consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.	There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 	accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 	and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 	North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 	inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 	security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 	trade.	The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 	recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 	first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 	transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 	new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 	circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 	highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 	respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.	The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 	creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 	*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 	able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;	*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 	combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;	*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 	effective multinational fighting forces;	*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 	scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 	they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;	*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 	meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 	training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 	and	*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 	we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.	If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 	partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 	states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 	perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 	take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 	same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 	foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 	close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 	cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 	transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.	The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 	Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 	attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 	dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 	Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 	levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 	attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 	alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 	invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.	The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 	not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 	ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 	*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 	global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 	close defense and diplomatic cooperation;	*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 	preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 	the region over the longer-term;	*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 	continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 	we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;	*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 	allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 	environment; and	*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 	institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 	forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 	change in this dynamic region.	We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 	competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 	internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 	three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 	global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.	With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 	Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 	Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 	critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 	long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 	States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 	country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 	needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 	Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 	Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.	United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 	refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 	challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 	global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 	World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 	promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 	created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 	cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 	continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 	former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 	neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 	into the Euro-Atlantic community.	At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 	divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 	build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 	motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 	relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 	democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 	of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 	weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 	opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 	decades.	The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 	relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 	require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 	democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 	government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 	have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 	the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 	in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.	Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 	and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 	while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 	India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 	which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 	with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 	future.	The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 	strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 	region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 	China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 	Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 	features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 	next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 	In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 	neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 	path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 	greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 	the only source of that greatness.	The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 	China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 	the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 	peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 	and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 	similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 	such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 	welfare of our citizens.	Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 	more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 	and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 	political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 	village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 	one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 	accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 	remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 	assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.	Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 	the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 	opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 	and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 	$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 	the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 	openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 	protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 	areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 	self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 	rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 	commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 	not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.	The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 	relations between the United States and other main centers of global 	power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 	in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 	must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 	become routine and unproductive.	Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 	can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 	analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 	that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 	the path of progress.	IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 	Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century	""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 	its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 	and enterprise of our people.""	President Bush	Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)	September 20, 2001	The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 	different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 	transformed.	It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 	We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 	highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 	*	assure our allies and friends;	*	dissuade future military competition;	*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and	*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.	The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 	forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 	strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 	confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 	deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 	how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 	occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 	challenges.	The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 	symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 	willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 	the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 	power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 	many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 	and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 	well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 	of U.S. forces.	Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 	planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 	across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 	of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 	developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 	strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 	This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 	ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 	U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 	infrastructure and assets in outer space.	Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 	approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 	intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 	technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 	run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 	Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 	the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 	wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 	coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.	We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 	experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 	and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 	whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 	States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 	sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 	will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 	military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 	United States.	Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 	against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 	around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 	fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 	with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 	targets.	We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 	keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 	appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 	and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 	capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 	knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 	the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 	to maximize injury.	We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 	integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 	the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 	inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 	information between intelligence and law enforcement.	*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 	to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 	capabilities;	*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 	seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 	the nation and our allies;	*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 	sustain our intelligence advantage;	*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 	through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 	capabilities; and	*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 	government with all-source analysis.	As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 	America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 	nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 	sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 	Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 	other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 	be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 	and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 	international politics must also extend their reach to understand 	complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 	health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.	Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 	wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 	requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 	police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 	government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 	cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 	readiness to play our part.	Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 	to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 	public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 	about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 	civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 	a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 	and this is an area where America must excel.	We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 	our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 	by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 	International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 	to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 	other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 	cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 	agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 	implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 	provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 	personnel and officials.	We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 	right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 	The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 	war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 	the American people.	Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 	diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 	a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 	and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 	our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 	vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 	bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 	As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 	until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 	is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 	of it.	In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 	interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 	apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 	disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 	our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 	such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 	our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.	Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 	skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 	our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 	entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 	energy. That is where our national security begins."

As 	several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 	most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 	to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 	Google bombing[3]. 	Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 	site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 	linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""	[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 	no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 	previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 	whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 	Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 	caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 	medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 	as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 	putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 	- New update, pagerank death?[8] 	- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 	- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 	longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 	false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]	, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 	Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 	degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 	sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 	good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 	frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 	tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 	didn't take long. 	- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 	hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 	unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 	Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 	- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 	newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 	betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 	- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 	site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 	(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 	didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 	that helpful. 	Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com	[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 	results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 	beginning of the end of Google's reign?"

Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of	this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even	for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents	of slaves, who were brought here by force.	More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.	Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in	wealth has nothing to do with it.	It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only	individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is	statistical sophistry.	Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth	is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when	there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes	400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there	since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on	wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,	they're nowhere near the top.	I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,	in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated	monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,	and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like	what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.	In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""	distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --	economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more	people living longer.	I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the	returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 	Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 	At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 	Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 	But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 	""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 	""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 	'Totally willing to help'	Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 	""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 	Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 	Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 	Medical rarity	No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 	One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 	He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 	Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 	There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 	Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 	Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 	More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 	One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 	But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 	Happy ending?	Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 	Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 	After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 	He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 	Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 	She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 	He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 	He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 	""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 	As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 	""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era	of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the	country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the	prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands	and the Republic is destroyed.""

I have to 	admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 	really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""	Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 	course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 	mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 	agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 	regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 	an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.	- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 	proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 	painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 	order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.	- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 	useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 	speed.	- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 	widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 	slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 	top usability problem.	- Message display - Yes. No argument here.	- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 	a mess.	- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 	separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 	multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 	you can eliminate the New submenu easily).	- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.	- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 	default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 	If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 	usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 	wants to fire it.)	- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 	completely irrelevant.	- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 	tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 	dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 	half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 	overconfigurable."

Still, definately something not right about the below. People are now	cheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already)	Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand	By Andrew Marshall	BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand	looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.	""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all	my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I	knew then there was something special.""	Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet	-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,	who is expecting their first child.	Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women	in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that	often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand	in search of a wife.	""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I	found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""	Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in	touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and	the couple married.	MR. MARRIAGE	Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency	Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""	started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction	agency.	Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.	""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my	knowledge, they have all been successful.""	Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that	require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.	Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women	looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.	Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's	office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and	language problems.	""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""	Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""	After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know	each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every	client has found a potential wife.	""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and	think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,	usually within the next year.	Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a	Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less	than 10 percent have broken up.	Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just	arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.	""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very	down, OK, we'll talk.""'	But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife	and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives	for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic	stress disorder.	WHY?	Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics	say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to	form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of	impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.	But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is	no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think	everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I	need Wan,"" he said.	""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no	secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem	with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to	their future husband.""	Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they	choose to use his agency.	His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,	over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British	singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are	not ""God's gift to women.""	Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their	own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.	""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques	or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?	Impossible,"" she said.	""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are	good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from	ladies from other countries.""	Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,	the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also	not a major obstacle.	""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having	a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she	couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic	dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up	very quickly.""	Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move	to the West.	""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them	how to eat, and when to make tea.""	PITFALLS	But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to	Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is	back in Bangkok, sad and angry.	""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him	happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never	spoke to me.""	Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy	there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""	Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure	unsuitable candidates are weeded out.	""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all	comers.""	Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the	arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,	looking for a foreign husband.	""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""	Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."""

If I see people living in mansions, or	even in suburban subdivisions, I assume	they didn't have too much trouble with	their titles.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view	of America"" to say that outside of Metro	Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or	two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)	is the boondocks.

Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the	user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't	vulnerable.	The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser	command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will	need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes.

Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning	FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my	wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other	services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we	get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On	occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a	reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in	which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see	over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an	occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.	I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated	with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,	to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor	files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I	haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether	this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This	paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph	above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)	At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email	processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,	perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?	Any ideas would be welcome.	Thanks,	Joe	Joe Berry	joe@topshot.com	AIM ""joe topshot""	Yahoo Msgr ""joetopshot""	jabber ""joetopshot@topshot.com""	Baltimore, MD	cell phone?  Get a new here for FREE!

If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use	separately from the process of highlighting something, that command	is something the application authors wrote on their own.

She also likes to have control over her environment, and this	means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting	the music playing.	By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design	from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market	niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.	The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but	doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead	requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI	disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the	button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever	get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a	surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again	when the music doesn't play.	For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,	within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the	button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't	change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you	press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be	the same.	The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI	disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle	CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a	problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,	that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and	wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but	which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it	hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to	understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the	CD.	Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is	a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the	player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing	the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,	but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and	FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the	binary distinction of music/no music.	What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start	playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it	would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.	The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half	the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so	there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.	The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of	the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The	device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip	open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It	should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'	without affecting the player.	- Jim"

What it boils down to is that	only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 	What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively	still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top	executive and management positions in the major French firms and the	government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not	officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws	and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 	Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them	from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many	can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about	the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about	it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect	this may hold true for other European countries as well.

I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's	booty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe	half an hour, and no, it's not too hard.

Then, every night, the spam fairy	swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of	things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's	done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.	This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read	their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work	about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports	appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.	Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail	client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to	train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd	start showing up in mail clients.

I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on	statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the	way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the	sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,	and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen	for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and	maybe me and you, too.	But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the	Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded	happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic	proto-warriors in the background.	You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily	Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye	covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't	mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom	we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come	off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the	British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his	arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe	off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and	thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if	we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him	to shut up.	Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before	September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all	thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political	persecution.	And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've	got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory	manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of	context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But	perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and	tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's	scoop.	Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier	this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his	allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were	meant to do stuff like that.	He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been	frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the	media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations	and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly	- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be	true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British	Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could	turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.	The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was	revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those	government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -	dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism	and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.	An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an	overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.	One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US	(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought	the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.	Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the	time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at	home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from	the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US	foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action	against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.	Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't	suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,	the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful	for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.	Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has	inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His	happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for	example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly	repellent.	And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire	to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful	appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the	ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.	Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that	are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.	The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing	remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution	is simply the pungency of his views.	It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his	rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This	is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.	You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And	if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of	unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is	not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man	up, therefore, won't make a difference.	The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.	But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.	4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now	forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com"

I *do* care about content.  Hell,	if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth	all day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced	that they will (stupid or not).	While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same	argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who	communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is	such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find	yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?	I don't buy it.	For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient	mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not	nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and	such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to	get a message across.	plant	camera,	Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just	don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying	that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't	easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way	that ""changed the face of communications"".	I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why	people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the	phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see	people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to	other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over	sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or	offline) photoalbum.	I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics	right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's	one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant	view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want	""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service	offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think	people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put	together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while	they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but	it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral	messaging method.	What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it	from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's	silly if people are going to flock to it.	I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.	The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately	are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event	will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile	phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of	what happened - before the press even gets there.

My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the	supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute	terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise	floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last	50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate	of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global	temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree	here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global	temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 	immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why	temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last	couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological	standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use	climate to push a particular social agenda.	It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited	during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of	humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers	paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a	bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried	in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the	ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save	the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their	existence has always been transient.	For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are	anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll	just stick with Occam's Razor for now.	In my humble opinion.

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 	Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 	I ended up writing it from scratch.

It took longer 	than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 	process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 	wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 	made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 	change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 	everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 	Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 	are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 	is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 	write more about what I learned. 	One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 	have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 	right hand corner.

What the WSJ said, appended below.	The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,	expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at	the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""	of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else	to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized	crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest	nation.	Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago	have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally	irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in	government.	As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly	usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will	be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and	special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the	cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize	to such perfection.	All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded	by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not	religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.	*Commerce*.	If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites	who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects	on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called	""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the	highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,	foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.	If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for	a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the	families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the	property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the	event.	And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as	tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square	feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.	In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic	internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially	decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,	economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition	and statism.	It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower	Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but	it's going to happen sooner or later.	And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who	died at the World Trade Center.	Cheers,	RAH	The Wall Street Journal	September 11, 2002	REVIEW & OUTLOOK	A Living Memorial	As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the	six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone	else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who	died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who	perished would be a living one.	The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,	heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of	the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were	attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best	expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be	to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries	working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of	productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin	Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.	But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has	been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous	rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the	Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and	scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now	clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,	and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance	to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.	This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out	what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor	George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November	re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the	memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the	commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space	for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning	to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so	successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for	an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.	A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's	anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They	want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas	- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have	had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in	New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World	Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are	cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own	anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One	family group even called a press conference to reject as	disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.	We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident	that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center	isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great	cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all	rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban	life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port	city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a	statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.	In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to	be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were	affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,	you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary	War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World	War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it	disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on	around the walls containing their names.	In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the	emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.	Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres	devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures	on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would	severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised	his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the	press and has since ducked for cover.	Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe	those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking	more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best	way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.	-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----	iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273	fgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2	=09az	-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----	44 Farquhar Street, Boston, MA 02131 USA	""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,	[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to	experience."" -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'"

Also I notice this story shows the truth - the 	Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just 	a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about 	Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military 	HQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.'	Owen	*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*	Staff Writer, CNET News.com	*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 	would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 	surveillance by police and spy agencies.*	released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 	Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 	right to be anonymous online.	The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 	in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 	conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 	draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 	early 2003.	Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 	Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 	combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 	these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 	Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 	process of considering.	If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 	possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 	providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 	permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 	electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 	most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 	agents to conduct Internet monitoring.	Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 	Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 	endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 	drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 	Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 	or ratified, the treaty.	University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 	justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 	weak.	""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 	changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 	make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 	argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 	make that case.""	Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 	powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 	number of cases where police have run into problems.""	Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 	compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 	their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 	orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 	Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 	applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.	""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 	Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 	capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 	security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 	responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.	Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 	the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 	proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 	just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 	only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 	the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 	does not adequately respect privacy rights.	Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 	of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 	personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 	implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 	providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 	the draft says.	Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 	activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""	""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 	mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 	anonymously,"" Hosein said.	A representative for George Radwanski 	the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 	the paper as it stands.""

But the energy	industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify	soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.	Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial	and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what	everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.	The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal	administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed	supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after	California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity	generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,	also driving up prices.	And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked	the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a	memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to	relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any	congestion.''	How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be	seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and	policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.	More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --	including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'	grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think	that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least	favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of	traditional, non-renewable energy sources.	If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any	fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the	state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a	reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.	State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.	Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if	it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the	utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''	notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for	Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).	It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --	tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could	achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better	job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to	inject real competition into the market.	We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity	defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation	is essential.	But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers	both.	The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up	the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities	will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable	sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.	But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer	model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer	ideas isn't enough.	The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small	generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,	harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is	coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.	Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.	California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax	incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't	done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did	react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's	lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it	altogether.	Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so	grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are	making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming	war in Iraq goes badly.	It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to	drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy	system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its	own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it	hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions.

It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image	of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is	intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is	not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary	if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.	There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the	early 1980s if not before.	A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement	snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information	must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you	wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly	adequate.	It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed	and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)	must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,	or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS	lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not	tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 	BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of	writing to RAID4 or RAID5...	I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense	to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do	not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and	there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk	may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault	recovery	and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?	Glenn Everhart	-----Original Message-----	attacks	Hi,	I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a	base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base	image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes	changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance	incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the	current disk image for that specific virtual machine.	This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the	honeypots mailing list)	Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server	applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,	even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.	The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are	layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server	running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net	business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one	of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database	server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one	partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the	partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from	one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap	space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.	When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that	shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or	Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But	what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or	""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the	redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be	minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from	backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high	availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is	always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at	the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater	performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be	applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions	(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)	Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept	been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?	I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in	this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server	systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and	non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly	ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or	no) downtime.

The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa	signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used	by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or	SHA-1 of each file).	The third problem doesn't really worry me.	These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique	to spam filtering.

Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation	between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to	be causal.	Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.	concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded	value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing	at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the	Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine	resolution).

Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok	record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.

Correct.	Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial	levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also	a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor.

Hettinga	Sunday, August 25, 2002	(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.	Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war	between thugs.	Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang	were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of	course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.	Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with	counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club""	putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in	hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite	a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by	the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not	for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,	only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to	its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime	there once and for all.	The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of	Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,	posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine	- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence	in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,	like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other	also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of	magnitude, not mere percentage points.	As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make	no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality""	of carnage, nation-wide.	So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one	gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at	least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with	apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on	the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger.	However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was	""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could	on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,	but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses	and busybodies"".	It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of	beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy	then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a	smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more	heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,	in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.	Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or	harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,	apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing	happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead	years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely	lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently	scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by	the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of	those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of	evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly	coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred	liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.	As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need	government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to	Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,	breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they	confiscate at tax time.	And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably	echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government	regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and	never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,	*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in	the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our	government now imposes on us.	And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.	In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have	predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant	imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the	neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had	better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an	absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.	Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who	were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle	of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it	or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which	saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market	control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the	imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,	movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little	Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now	strictly political, descendents.	In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.	Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in	human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style	Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its	most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that	was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic	control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a	race war between thugs up in Boston.	This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least	fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and	endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right""	reasons.	As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation	that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit.	Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,	what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of	people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.	Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead.	""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --	and real bandits -- everywhere.	Cheers,	RAH	&pagewanted=print&position=top	The New York Times	August 25, 2002	BUTTERFIELD	BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar	Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional	investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of	New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.	Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.	Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,	""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log	of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the	F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an	alley, shot six times.	Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known	gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England	Mafia was involved.	But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real	killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were	left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to	death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing	to do with it.	One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with	the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.	for $300 million for false imprisonment.	His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the	Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,	corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston	office in its effort to bring down the mob.	The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years	in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of	the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,	including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca	approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation	by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the	department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.	The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently	including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents	were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were	protecting them from prosecution.	""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal	himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a	witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect	one of his informants.""	Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and	may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark	who worked for Mr. Barboza.	Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.	Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a	spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the	pending litigation.	A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate	misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the	investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting	sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and	obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were	F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and	Stephen Flemmi are brothers.	The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,	Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston	office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge	that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.	Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,	including who fired the first shot.	Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what	progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.	In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston	office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot	wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially	could be an excellent informant.""	The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have	killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue	to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's	potential outweighs the risk involved.""	A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most	frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,	the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is	no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.""	The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political	pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing	power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.	agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties	to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.	Bulger.	Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and	the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually	helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled	organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take	over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while	the F.B.I. looked the other way.	One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.	Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional	investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device	in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who	transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was	coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,	the investigators say.	Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted	in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on	parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state	judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents	suggesting his innocence.	Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their	survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million	lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to	die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when	Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.	Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with	his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30	years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put	on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each	other.	-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----	iQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb	3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI	=OELD	-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----	44 Farquhar Street, Boston, MA 02131 USA	""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,	[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to	experience."" -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'"

Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,	D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering	contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic	X-ray sources.''	Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other	half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the	University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant	underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from	the sun by the billion.	Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because	they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.	In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South	Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.	Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino	detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and	also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of	the brightest objects in the universe.	The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for	building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and	sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.	His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the	discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the	hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.	When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside	Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba	also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach	Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.	This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney	Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,	55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the	Karolinska Institute.	The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ	growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how	viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as	AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.	The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday	morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of	Alfred Nobel later the same day.	The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish	Academy said on Tuesday.	The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -	will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.	The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are	not publicly revealed for 50 years.	Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who	endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.	In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to	those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and	``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field	of physics.''	The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and	economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts	in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted	in strict secrecy.	The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in	1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes	that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to	preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also	believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are	participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download	copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions	such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see	businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of	copyrighted works.	""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think	they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal	prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same	conference panel.	I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is	hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or	warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor	deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits	carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate	further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to	initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems	participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from	the crowd.	The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines	purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the	reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any	180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more	copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....	For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution	of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish	willful infringement.	The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of	anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.	Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""	even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the	value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15	to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the	perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.	507. Limitations on actions	(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained	under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five	years after the cause of action arose.	(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the	provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after	the claim accrued.	The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in	criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.	I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to	prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess	would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent	individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be	targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created	meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion	under any other guise.	Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems	the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill	faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the	European way of doing things is beyond me.	The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack	for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""	anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?	I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see	coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 	For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,	but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.	I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast	majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the	country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled	anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 	Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of	Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But	from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this	way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the	years.	I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.	First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and	culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout	North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and	very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the	hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly	foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with	having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally	identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A	Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with	your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same	language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a	wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New	Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live	than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are	farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.	Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a	neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 	In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your	German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,	only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous	superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?	In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the	US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with	relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very	similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have	dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an	advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't	understand a word they are saying either. 	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com"

(It is	amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for	UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and	its battery supply...)	First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was	occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a	sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of	such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.	@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@	     set seq {}	     set rseq {}	     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {	+	if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {	+	    # just ignore anything bogus	+	    continue;	 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]	 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {	 	    lappend seq $parts	That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring	before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should	probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue""	if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).	But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,	by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,	I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than	have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it	would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to	do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck	a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the	user has typed.	This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe	allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can	be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have	to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.	But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.	If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that	is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a	different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the	current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current	input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it,	I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That	kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.	And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special	use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from	the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different	restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name	beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,	so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to	toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name	being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I	can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to	exist and be typed.	Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another	feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is	the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and	the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now	show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.	So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes	that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something	else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it	discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order	to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.	And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it	clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).	Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next	message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had	reverted to its usual bindings.	In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe	that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the	""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really	need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just	for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not	the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).	kre	@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@	     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]	@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@	     append select(sel) $a	     if ![info exists select(folder)] {	 proc SelectBackSpace { w } {	@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@	 proc SelectToggle {w} {	     global select	     if [info exists select(folder)] {	+	if {$select(sel) != """"} {	+	    SelectTypein $w +	+	    return	 	set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]	     } else {	@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@	+proc SelectPrev {w} {	+    global select	+    if [info exists select(folder)] {	+	SelectTypein $w ""-""	+    } else {	+	catch {	+	    incr select(sel) -1	 proc SelectComplete { w } {	     global select	     if [info exists select(folder)] {	@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@	-proc SelectReturn { w } {	+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {	     global select	     if [info exists select(folder)] {	+	if {$a != {}} {	+	    SelectTypein $w $a	+	    return	 	if [info exists select(match)] {	 	    set select(sel) $select(match)	 	    unset select(match)	@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@	 	unset select(folder)	     $select(entry) configure -state disabled	 proc SelectClear { w } {	Exmh-workers mailing list	Exmh-workers@redhat.com"

Let me emphasize something 	the target audience for Phoenix.	Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.	- critical to my day-to-day use 	- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?	-  link what?	- The sidebar is 	- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 	- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 	splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 	panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 	- a waste of real estate	- Form auto-fill 	- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 	first 	- should just happen automatically	- Downloads 	- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 	- should be clearly visible and understandable.	- Toolbars should 	- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 	window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 	able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 	able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 	context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 	system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 	mow my lawn and... 	- be customizable within reason	- Composer should 	- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 	Everywhere! 	- not be part of a Web browser.	- Mail should 	- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 	difference? 	- be a separate application.	Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 	you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 	the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 	mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 	yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 	facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 	alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 	automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 	Why? 	A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 	as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 	geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.	Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 	opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 	browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 	user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 	within Netscape."

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon	products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as	a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -	there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,	but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 	much more easily within the petrochemical industry.	Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower	oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 	war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from	waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 	Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 	petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 	of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously	being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 	matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock	oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the	gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 	cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.	My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.	Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals	(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 	difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the	petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect	that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,	just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,	for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.	All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling	like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from	Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section	began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do	with Dr. Rajcoomar.	Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back	to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight	man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer	refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying	out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.	They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him	in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite	jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight	attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,	already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were	not ready to let things quiet down.	One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The	marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and	remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any	reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try	disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.	The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were	terrorists on the plane.	""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized	cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of	Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an	aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire	in a shootout.""	Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her	husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that	there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore	did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the	bathroom, he or she might be shot.	There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When	the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into	custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals	grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that	anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where	he was thrown into a filthy cell.	This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.	Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.	Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into	custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening	hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.	Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were	eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.	McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,	which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.	The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the	incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.	Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too	closely.""	If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters	are headed for jail.	Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I	had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I	was about to be beaten up or killed.""	Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and	he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful	detention.	""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said	Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in	this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of	security.""	44 Farquhar Street, Boston, MA 02131 USA	""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,	[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to	experience."" -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'"

Especially when 	the data in their own list	contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited, 	growed"" entries. I guess if	I read it enough times my vision will clear.	I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning 	no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this 	smart person decided	that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee 	(non-refundable). During attendance at	my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for 	it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it	has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European 	(and Canadian) business	schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used 	the words ""American nobility.""	""invented"" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess 	""practically"" gets you	around that problem.	Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 	study found that college graduates	earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 	They did decline to mention	that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of	them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 	the average salary for	a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 	half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 	centers that	have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 	entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an	hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 	1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference	is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 	words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 	 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 	to this is that many college graduates	 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 	that we are the thin edge	(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 	third-world wages and work practices coming	 to North America.	I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 	could maintain that (and prosper) just says	 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 	there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote	with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 	employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway	eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 	employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were	that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 	rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed	 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 	guess what - used to be a VP at the company.	That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 	as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long	as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 	place.	And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 	some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,	are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 	generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about	the labor markets here.	Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 	have difficulty finding any - except of course for	labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 	unless the supply is tight)	It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 	self-made billionaires on	the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 	concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""	which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 	galling example is	high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 	it is an area where the pricing	approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 	telecom industry (maintain your	monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 	the same regulators) meet.	Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 	entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing	seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 	seems less important than using	regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 	produce profits for the favored few.	I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 	they're the biggest believers in	the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 	rights of that ""proletariat"" you've	just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 	in the hands of a few (ideally people	who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 	and lie - use	the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 	amount of poverty reduction actually	helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 	Republic party seems to be the more homeless under	 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.	And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 	standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,	greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 	work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right	 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 	standards of living) is the reality.	Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 	""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 	the top 20% of households""	Owen"

Also I notice this story shows the truth - the 	Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just 	a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about 	Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military 	HQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.'	Owen	*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*	Staff Writer, CNET News.com	*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 	would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 	surveillance by police and spy agencies.*	released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 	Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 	right to be anonymous online.	The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 	in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 	conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 	draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 	early 2003.	Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 	Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 	combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 	these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 	Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 	process of considering.	If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 	possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 	providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 	permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 	electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 	most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 	agents to conduct Internet monitoring.	Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 	Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 	endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 	drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 	Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 	or ratified, the treaty.	University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 	justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 	weak.	""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 	changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 	make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 	argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 	make that case.""	Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 	powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 	number of cases where police have run into problems.""	Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 	compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 	their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 	orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 	Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 	applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.	""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 	Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 	capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 	security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 	responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.	Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 	the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 	proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 	just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 	only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 	the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 	does not adequately respect privacy rights.	Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 	of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 	personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 	implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 	providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 	the draft says.	Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 	activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""	""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 	mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 	anonymously,"" Hosein said.	A representative for George Radwanski 	the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 	the paper as it stands.""

1224,ham,"[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically	 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]	OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and	I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the	  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file	    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any ""junk mail	    condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)	    ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command),	    ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected	    after the message headers/body are read).	    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest	      - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast	        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some	        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin	      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a	        verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"",	        and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS	        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that	        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS	        lookups timeout)	  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those	    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This	    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder	    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the	    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject	    the message.	    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name	    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the	    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is	    retained in saved messages.)	    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew	    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows	    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is	          folder = ""virus""	          run through SpamAssassin	              folder = ""rejected-spam""	              folder = ""caught-spam""	    By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles	    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk	    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually	    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to	    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)	    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,	    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)	    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep	    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair	    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,	    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)	    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called	    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB	    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by	    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry	    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf	    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the	    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or	    body.	    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is	    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP	    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This	    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and	    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam	    detectors.  Tim?

All of those who	perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers	and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic	amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish	that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,	indeed, for all of us.	But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square	feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers	must be replaced on the site.	About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,	along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.	Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the	economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%	of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms	have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New	York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit	may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.	If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the	vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,	and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers	made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a	symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were	destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and	with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.	In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many	sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on	all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square	feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or	simply never rebuilt.	These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be	recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over	the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the	office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.	Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.	That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy	before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has	remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway	and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements	planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct	""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes	even more the logical locus of office development.	And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task	force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury	Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60	million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the	anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only	heightens the need.	As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown	cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that	history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of	office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased	up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the	beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,	at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.	We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site	over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on	line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an	annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'	rate.	Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it	previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an	extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor	will most New Yorkers.	Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times	future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --	and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural	significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what	happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as	residents of the area.	The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for	granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it	just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore	XML almost completely. 	I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to	apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how	completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration	of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the	occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was	functional): this seems more the case in open source content management	than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to	ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).	The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of	current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written	down what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks so	widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is	no hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial	systems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really much	more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, take	some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale	pretty well.""

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after	regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant	pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the	vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I	can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers	down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of	the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of	the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for	the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.

Given that our whole business	plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't	understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be	unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the	potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the	Habeas warrant mark.	Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on	your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only	license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on	the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove	us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it	has a chance to show any promise.	At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it	encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those	without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the	transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't	steal any more cars.

At first I thought it	might be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody	believes this.	M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.	DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on	their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in	Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked	together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid	derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.	The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities	with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a	description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see	them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but	not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth	even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a	renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.	The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter	Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long	bow. Targets do not come much bigger.	Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that	there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard	their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They	survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.	They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet	(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves	but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.	Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the	dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also	to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote	viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are	contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be	encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and	mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help	so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great	difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove	all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of	Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus	if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of	all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their	psi.	THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to	hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.	Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of	rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young	hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made	them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to	keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this	they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an	act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the	ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and	so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have	become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.	Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep	them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and	only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend	to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is	primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not	suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.	Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,	even if they are standing on ice.	Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act	of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female	can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird	sitting on a nest.	Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,	while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate	all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.	If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then	purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our	religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,	regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to	concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has	built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using	""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.	Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of	dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity	tends to purge all malice back to its roots.	It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,	aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on	vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the	serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.	ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take	control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the	following.	Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.	Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing	hormones, abilities, etc.	Mind machines.	The original engraving or engram.	GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T	hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the	first job holders.	TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of	time.	My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.	The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic	Subconscious, etc.	EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.	Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever	one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the	higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or	other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.	Every extinct race, etc.	BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via	genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not	support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is	nobody's problem but Habeas's.	A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of	incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet	to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...	This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all	its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject	at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  	If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,	thresholds to 5.	Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor	of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message	basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.	Sorry, that just can't work.	If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,	and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,	SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then	spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody	left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their	will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.	Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to	make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose	for which it was designed.	Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against	real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,	then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights	to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both	created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that	everybody has to pay them for.	The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do	absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with	lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly	from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the	privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll	ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.	[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 	consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.	Welcome to geek heaven.

""Nowhere in the world	are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of	nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to	lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide	the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate	new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will	ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""	The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology	program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also	create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National	Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and	technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.	""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to	change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer	revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will	mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the	bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a	half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various	nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader	in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to	achieving that goal.	To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for	Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to	Nanotechnology would also be established.	According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the	National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the	National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.	Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;	emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and	short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,	equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research	that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting	interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology	transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal	implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,	educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for	measuring progress toward program goals."

In recent years,	scientific research has suggested that people who have	strong friendships experience less stress, they recover	more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live	longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible	to the common cold, studies show. 	But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,	insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too	much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling	attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 	""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet	Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of	Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,	envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will	rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing	is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this	is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 	Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a	sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,	advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.	""There's this myth that friendships should last a	lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that	they end."" 	That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight	the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering	that they have only recently paid close attention to	friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -	between siblings or parents and children - have been seen	as more important. 	Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead	to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And	children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go	bad. 	As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.	Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my	best friend hits me."" 	Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the	University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,	like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the	role of friends in emotional and physical health. 	""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for	stability the way it was in the past, and because people	are less likely to be living with or near extended family	members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as	a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.	Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 	Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship	focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look	at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,	a professor of psychology at Florida International	University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has	negative characteristics."" 	The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet	measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.	So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,	figured out that it is a significant problem. The early	research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a	friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 	How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by	drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised	pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at	Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support	antisocial behavior."" 	Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends	split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of	psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is	often in cases where one has shared personal information or	secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""	Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend	suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's	more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent	treatment is actually malicious."" 	At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's	romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.	Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in	there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 	A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults	the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who	responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship	described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her	""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated	that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with	people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 	Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,	but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people	constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll	have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or	she finds out."" 	Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme	kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the	only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying	the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is	overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person	who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and	the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 	Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone	from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but	something always comes up at the last minute to someone who	promises to be there for you when you need them, but then	isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 	Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,	when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons	to dislike the other one. 	""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to	discover there's something important they don't like about	the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.	""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other	person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,	it may take even more time for one person to meet the	other's dislike criteria."" 	Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,	""depends on how large the injury is."" 	""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let	something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity	sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 	Acceptance should come easier among friends than among	spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one	friend and do not need a full range of emotional support	from each one. 	But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where	one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the	friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is	to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal	or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to	get together, ever. 	""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,	but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 	Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far	easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also	comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a	bad friendship should leave a person with more time and	appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 	""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have	them in order while you're healthy and your life and work	are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,	when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your	health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash	course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and	life-preserving good friendship is.""

Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 	 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio	 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,	 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.	 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take	 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the	 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.	 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa	 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.	 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his	 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.	 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,	 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.	 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police	 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers	 from video footage.	 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as	 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact	 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.	 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on	 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade	 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.	 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.	 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary	 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last	 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not	 grab their reins.	 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'	 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend	 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.	 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles	 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of	 the Assumption of the Virgin.	4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now	forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com"

Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000	more machines for the Japanese market. 	They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,	1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the	film rental industry and in homes. 	Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 	""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the	market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to	secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 	Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the	format. 	The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the	television and film industries and will be unaffected. 	But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin	for Betamax home players. 	In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 	Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of	competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 	The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,	although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 	A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no	new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 	Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in	particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to	work on client's systems.	My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on	Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.	Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.	They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a	service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to	run C programs.	Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management	If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,	then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.	You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time	on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends	entirely on the programmer, not the language.	Buzzword.	Unsupported assertion.	Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC	in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be	10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable	libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.	At least that is the case when then language you used is available on	You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get	some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for	maintenance headaches ad infinitum.	Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking	time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could	wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's	in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code	that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,	or I can do it now when very few people can.	Yes.	It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes	me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!	Not.	Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.	Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.	I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for	courses.	Bye,	  Rob."

The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human	activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating	after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that	these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for	increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.	Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the	past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming	isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to	understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on	global human activity.	The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.	It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment	subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the	current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2	concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth	should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may	be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I	encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to	eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident	as heat.	- Jim"

That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 	pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 	attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 	what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 	question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 	question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 	it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk.

As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 	around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 	to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 	say, a governtment intelligence service.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.	It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over	spending spreads the damage more evenly.

Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering	   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses	   the pores and makes your skin glow.	3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that	   romantic dinner.	4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches	   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable	   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!	5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body	   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and	   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.	6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually	   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called	   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!	7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE	   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.	8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages	   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid	   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.	9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release	   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.	10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national	    antihistamine.

That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 	were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 	heart). 	Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 	well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 	asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 	it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 	not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 	ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 	angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 	because of this is small. That's quite a relief.

In fact, let's do that. 	If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 	design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 	- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 	required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 	number of parsers around the world. 	- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 	thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 	- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 	egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 	obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 	- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 	namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 	resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 	- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 	add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 	spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 	- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 	semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 	fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 	same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 	and inconsistent behavior across consumers. 	RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 	For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 	pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 	format, we have the worst one possible. 	Except, of course, for all the others. 	The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 	necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 	has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 	weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 	possible in the first place. 	- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 	- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 	content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 	valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 	mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 	introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 	display through unclosed HTML elements. 	- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 	matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 	where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 	and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 	in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 	flexibility. 	Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 	computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 	Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 	it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 	ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 	over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the 	- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 	fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 	- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 	the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 	later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 	parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 	parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 	is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 	Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 	recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 	actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 	of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 	feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 	world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 	into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 	- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 	haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 	flourishing. 	Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 	thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to 	their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. 	- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 	My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 	TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 	nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 	littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 	If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 	be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 	perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 	There is no middle ground. 	- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 	earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 	they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 	descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 	practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 	them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 	faces. 	- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 	Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list 	of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 	any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 	0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 	&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is 	missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 	group can design a better system in the long haul. 	Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 	formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 	syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 	Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 	partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition."

Note the very careful wording, so	exhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day	with some cheese.	Interesting timing, since 16,000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have	to worry about death from this anymore.	- Adam L. ""Duncan"" Beberg	  beberg@mithral.com	By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer	WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other	sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection	Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.	The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's	push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines	and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.	While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of	exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both	animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer	risk to humans.	""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental	exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health	effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and	uncertainties are involved.""	The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various	world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly	significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel	emissions under the Clean Air Act.	Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush	administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that	would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a	separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.	EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with	the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,	the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone	the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to	meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.	The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,	although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel	is expected to produce pollution reductions.	The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the	probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to	diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when	gauging pollution health concerns.	But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are	considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of	cancer risk to an individual.	Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal	and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be	carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to	environmental exposure.""	The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses	short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a	""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and	other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for	as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.	Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs	to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road	diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency	expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust	sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.	Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private	harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement	clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent	standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""	Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology	Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is	clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times	cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""	The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in	the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow	turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road."

These calculations only work if the	object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity	for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go	faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the	most part. 	All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the	square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 	really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I	think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of	the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).

I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only	have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,	and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain	text (non-whitespace) between them.

This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus	there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into	his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an	espresso.	That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,	and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one	that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,	after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound	of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000	residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle	also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's	Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.	A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the	tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the	consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""	said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was	common sense.""	Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that	people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But	because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on	espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.	Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a	year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research	shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.	Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The	think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of	low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.	Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs	made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would	provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,	improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.	At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of	customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.	Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an	extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with	it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got	to come from somewhere.""	Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she	brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She	supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be	the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.	Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.	David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a	day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for	one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a	leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I	think everyone should pay.""	Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as	JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's	Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,	Starbucks and Tully's.	The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that	contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare	for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If	espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a	city audit.	University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. 	""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is	neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead	to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to	avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using	finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]	and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be	right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal	fees that could have gone to child care.	""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious	idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso	drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with	the espresso drinkers?""	In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political	two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public	stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,	corporations continually advertise their commitment to social	activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members	prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.	""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and	childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we	contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not	understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an	additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single	consumer product.""	The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before	voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at	vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through	higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.	The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of	espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.	Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of	consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been	pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime	every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.	It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds	funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""	Best regards,"

In a number of cases, CO2 level increases	are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the	increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature	preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done	of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are	correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly	causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a	fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an	authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.	With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to	point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly	regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle	peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this	cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete	cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and	time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it	happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous	cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other	words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we	would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical	record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2	concentrations.	Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately	affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely	predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative	feedback systems mentioned above.	Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it	makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and	methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule	basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something	that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the	biosphere.	CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent	studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a	passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't	think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in	understanding warming trends.	Cheers,	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com"

Owen	Internet can level the political playing field	By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro	NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 	of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 	malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 	stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 	public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 	personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 	ask for our votes.	Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 	has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.	In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 	Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 	addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 	each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.	That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 	expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 	spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 	35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.	Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 	been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 	would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 	through any of those channels.	The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 	was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 	entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 	refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 	``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.	His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 	because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 	may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 	in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 	mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.	No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 	highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 	it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 	unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.	The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 	that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 	believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 	TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 	simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 	future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 	taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.	When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 	Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 	to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 	percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 	accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.	Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 	Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 	ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 	groups.	But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 	an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 	opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 	the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 	advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 	Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 	they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.	Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 	advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 	the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 	founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 	for the Los Angeles Times. "

It naturally spiked startup time and window time 	slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 	policy for regressions.	While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 	misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 	add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 	features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 	relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 	user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 	feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!	You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 	requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 	people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 	people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 	second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 	continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 	but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 	them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 	sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 	he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 	Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 	to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 	doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 	eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.	We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 	nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 	features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 	Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 	some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 	download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 	will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser."

1683,ham,"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all	Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.	Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely	to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even	L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to	their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)	My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a	client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only	going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams	the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The	MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is	retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual	oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)	and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA	fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not	clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.	Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all	MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's	IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification.

The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said	Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in	the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.	Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute	ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.	But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of	checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.	There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative	export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are	GM-free.	Aid	Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with	Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.	""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in	accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other	countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists.	""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said.	Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern	Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the	region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.	The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes	of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.	The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's	campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has	worsened the situation, say many donors.	Lost markets	The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.	Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling	it as 'poison' .	Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be	planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.	United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that	Americans eat GM maize every day.

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All	October 2, 2002	By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 	Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""	Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the	World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds	would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness	was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The	reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News	program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 	There was only one problem, the health organization said in	a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds	would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the	subject. 	""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports	originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United	Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we	have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 	All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,	cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a	blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.	But none reported any scientific details from the study or	the names of the scientists who conducted it. 	On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a	""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this	is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women	and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural	blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth	within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as	brunets."" 	Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""	Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the	anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London	who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 	In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that	unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in	Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected	the last true blond to hail from Finland. 	The British accounts were replete with the views of	bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow	blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare	genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an	endangered species. 	Journalists in London said last night that the source of	the reports was probably one of several European news	agencies that are used by the British press, but it	remained unclear which one. 	Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the	report was probably distributed by The Press Association,	Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it	up,"" he said. 	But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press	Association, said that although it had considered running	the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking	to the World Health Organization. 	""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the	World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us	that report was two years old, and had been covered at the	time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a	German news agency."" 	She added that she did not know which agency the	organization was referring to. 	Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California	at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for	blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

I believe a suitable memorial	surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,	children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such	as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works	would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.	What do you think should done with the space?	Joe Adams	Hillsdale, New Jersey	I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan	that's designed by committee and that's gone through	public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold	and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more	public space that the public hates, of which there are	plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city	and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young	ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the	towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic	events occurred in New York that in any other city would	be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and	historical museums and in New York there's barely a	little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.	It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for	their big chance, and compared to that spirit of	entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a	statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's	Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President	Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb	and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all	the things that New York is about. If you want to find	Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New	city. New York is for the young and lively."

In certain circumstances the main process and the	application child process seem to lock up both waiting	for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I	have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that	the semaphore code is doing the correct things for	syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the	semop() system call.	I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay	between changing semaphore states the problem goes	away, but this causes our entire application to run	really sloooww !! lol	Is there anything weird or different with the standard	implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could	cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state	in a semaphore immediately?	EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails	(-1) also fixes the problem but again system	performance goes down the toilet.	both the parent controlling process run as the same	uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with	permissions 0666.

Daev Walsh forwards an article from	The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised	in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy	was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I	now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely	legal, way to make money.	A story of my new neighbourhood...	The Irish Digest July 1964	The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler	The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.	Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life 	DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the	architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of	beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these	beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one	who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""	The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means	of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""	bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground	with wooden plugs, one in each hand.	Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been	born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing	him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an	unusually handsome face.	This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating	sympathetic passers-by from their small change.	The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many	lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century	Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would	come along.	He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his	black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a	handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.	""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily	owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were	substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could	indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.	As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.	The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening	as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing	through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on	Dublin's North Quays.	When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a	ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the	beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.	Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay	concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two	powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.	In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy	was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's	purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was	found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her	assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a	deformed beggar.	Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting	the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.	On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy	servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to	strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder	and caused a great stir.	Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months	""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this	period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first	case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.	Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old	pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and	robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a	nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled	along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that	finished Billy's career of crime.	Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment	after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to	hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the	ditch.	Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and	tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,	however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.	Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her	large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.	The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the	district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member	of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.	""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but	they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The	Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive	Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed	and giggled as they wended their way home at night.	daev	Rev.

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a	speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 	""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation	system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""	said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published	recently. 	The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding	itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 	Speaking in tongues 	""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert	Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 	Translators could be essential for US soldiers	""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up	and you are holding them apart. 	""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and	talk to them,"" he said. 	The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially	available laptops. 	The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.	So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 	""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and	typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. 	Slow system 	For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who	knew just a smattering of English. 	The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in	Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated	into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 	""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was	slow in translating phrases. 	The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the	field. 	But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to	work with further research and development. 	The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between	the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon	University.

Histor		tests=AWL		version=2.50-cvs	We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 	Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 	abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 	they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 	capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 	information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 	every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 	(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 	relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 	programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 	for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 	ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 	place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 	always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 	relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 	Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 	every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 	this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 	a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 	Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 	information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 	the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 	which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them.

Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 	purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 	what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 	feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 	other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 	existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 	biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 	to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 	but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 	of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 	happy and keep buying more site licenses. 	But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 	software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 	our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 	who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 	yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 	built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 	inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 	of it. 	Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 	hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)"

This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically	(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need	to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or	carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under	weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the	mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from	bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength	cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the	muscular enhancement.	If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure	modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to	think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then	what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened	cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout	the entire nervous system.  	Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly	hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal	sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,	everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle	hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;	don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus	would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the	heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We	know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time	was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself	already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence	his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.	Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine	'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological	perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but	just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his	self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his	cognitive time-scales.	""Computers are useless.  They can only give you answers.""(Pablo Picasso)"

Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 	the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 	related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 	hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 	obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 	G-Force Dyno-Staff.	I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 	something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 	particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 	Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.	To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 	seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 	religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 	irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 	contrast with our (my) modern mental models.	I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 	justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.	(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)	We create the world we live in.	A loving person lives in a loving world,	A hostile person lives in a hostile world.	Everyone you meet is your mirror.	You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 	as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 	waste what you do have.	The past is dead,	The future is imaginary,	Happiness can only be	in the Eternal Now Moment	How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 	direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.	Love a person because he or she is there.	This is the only reason.	Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 	and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.	The	purpose	of our lives	is to be free	of all addictive traps,	and thus	become one	with the ocean of	Living Love.	sdw	Stephen D.

According to scuttlebutt that	emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,	Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President	Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,	the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the	French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't	have a word for entrepreneur.""	The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness	Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had	recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.	Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness	Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did	receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of	communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime	minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly	never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""	Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must	have been a joke.""	This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of	a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than	stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories	too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've	chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the	moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the	ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged	as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the	intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus	quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win	the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it	was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks	to chortling up their sleeves.	Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual	shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they	seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this	public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever	been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at	some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always	fall upon appreciative ears.	Barbara ""ears of corn"" Mikkelson"

The fake site was used to squeeze	 more money out of people they had already hooked. 	 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,	 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being	 taken in by the fake website. 	 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a	 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African	 nations. 	 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would	 otherwise spot the scam. 	 Convincing site 	 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an	 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out	 their victims. 	 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in	 front of the bank's name. 	 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS	 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced	 online."" 	 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people	 behind it have not been caught. 	 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 	 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many	 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 	 Domain games 	 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or	 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any	 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 	 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such	 crimes. 	 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking	 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe	 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 	 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to	 it. 	 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in	 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 	 Cutting edge fraud 	 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of	 legitimacy. 	 People tricked into clicking on fake sites	 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in	 place of the certificates. 	 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web	 technology,"" said the spokesman. 	 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website	 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African	 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 	 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to	 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has	 been deposited in their name. 	 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically	 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 	 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national	 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 	 Modern gloss 	 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that	 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give	 old cons a modern gloss. 	 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come	 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two	 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 	 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be	 true, undoubtedly is. 	 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment	 service Paypal. 	 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account	 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 	 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed	 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

You can have a	base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base	image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes	changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance	incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the	current disk image for that specific virtual machine.	This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the	honeypots mailing list)	Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server	applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,	even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.	The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are	layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server	running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net	business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one	of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database	server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one	partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the	partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from	one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap	space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.	When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that	shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or	Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But	what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or	""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the	redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be	minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from	backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high	availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is	always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at	the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater	performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be	applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions	(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)	Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept	been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?	I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in	this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server	systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and	non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly	ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or	no) downtime.	Thanks for any opinions,	Ben"

""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 	and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of	""promiscuity"".

All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first	journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of	the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly	from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).	Today's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,	since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this	journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top	researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the	ideas that led to many Web technologies.

They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 	    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 	    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 	    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 	    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 	    to violate copyrights. 	    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 	    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 	    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 	    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 	    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 	    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 	    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 	    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing.

Having lost my 10 years	of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point	at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to	another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I	had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 	desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along	with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],	I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  	After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am	really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills	first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]	but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,	(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The	number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After	less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost	all my menus and controls setup just the way I want.

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the	standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the	world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending	images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text	files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part	of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a	recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 	How can I read a MIME message?	Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use	which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing	number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular	MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the	University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host	ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)	In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation	capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do	not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is	still hope! 	There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME	message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed	at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the	host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions	available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with	older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also	decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 	Does MIME replace UUENCODE?	Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so	that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical	limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust	encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the	message transformations made by certain email gateways. 	How can I learn more about MIME?	The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via	     o  US East Coast                            	     o  US West Coast                            	     o  Pacific Rim                              	     o  Europe                                   	Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt	Another source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"",	which includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list."

Try this in any other ramdom	application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There	normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary	selection (that is, set it to be a null string).	Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will	find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert	point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the	PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing	else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from	either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was	deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.	That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated	insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the	confidential material contains data and expert analysis	developed by some of the nation's most respected	engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that	have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the	crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,	helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to	the collapses. 	An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the	debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been	accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what	government analysts have been able to put together as they	struggle to answer the scientifically complex and	emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly	failures of the buildings. 	But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of	victims fear that the closely held information, which	includes the analysis and the possible answers that	families and engineers around the world have craved, may	remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. 	Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the	experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they	wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are	typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it	now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that	certain material can remain secret for the time being - has	approved standard legal arrangements that, should the	lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial	material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. 	""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but	we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,	an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,	who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why	edition, 2002). 	""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole	process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. 	Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the	south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper	Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.	""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I	would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a	moral obligation."" 	The lawsuit that has generated the information involves	Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the	trade center property, and a consortium of insurance	companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner	that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist	attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half	that amount, as the insurance companies say. 	As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have	spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert	opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. 	Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of	Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said	of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements	that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He	conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20	insurers on his side of the case could complicate any	release of the material. 	As for his own company, whose consultants alone have	produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of	diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt	would be made to give the material eventually to ""public	authorities and investigative teams."" 	Still, some of that analysis relies on information like	blueprints and building records from other sources, like	the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built	and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in	the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the	differing origins of the material would influence his	company's ability to release information. 	In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents	would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with	applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate	with ""federal investigations."" 	The fate of the research is particularly critical to	resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,	given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into	the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the	Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few	resources, a lack of access to crucial information like	building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.	A new federal investigation intended to remedy those	failings has just begun at the National Institute of	Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has	studied many building disasters. 	Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make	final determinations and recommendations for other	buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded	up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on	the lawsuit. 	Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of	the real estate executive's own heavily financed	investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to	say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST	investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was	in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but	said no transfer had taken place. 	With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by	both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body	of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the	trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. 	""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said	Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner	at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier	inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the	future."" 	Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one	governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,	from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such	information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the	reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to	have them sealed forever. 	""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep	some of those documents secret for one reason or another,	some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First	Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. 	Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the	information, the court might look favorably on requests to	make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the	material is unnerving to many people, especially experts	who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -	not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect	their own interests - could lead to an advance in the	federal investigation of the trade center. 	""It's important for this to get presented and published and	subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,	director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure	Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the	case, ""because then the general engineering community can	sort it out."" 	The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by	any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger	Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called	upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with	the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of	the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. 	The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of	the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged	core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and	proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -	which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped	pinpoint the structural failures. 	The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer	modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to	the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks	immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints	hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to	the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of	Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a	consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he	had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground	zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how	the towers fell. 	Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things	actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the	specific locations."" 	Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details	of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details	of computer calculations his company has done on the spread	of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.	Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of	photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of	which he believes have not been available to other	investigators. 	And the investigation has not limited itself to computers	and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind	tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining	the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed	the weakening structures. 	Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort	Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but	had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the	original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For	the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more	detailed measurements than in the original design."" 	""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in	themselves for understanding how wind and buildings	interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be	valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think	I've told you all I can.""

Owen	*Political spam on your cell phone?*	Special to ZDNet News	*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 	the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 	declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 	who funded them.*	In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 	messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 	easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 	information won't be required.	The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 	campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 	same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 	political spam.	Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 	asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 	financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 	use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.	Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 	the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 	supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 	Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 	groups.	FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 	commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 	potential to reach more voters.	""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 	everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said.	Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 	allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 	messages while remaining anonymous.	Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.	Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 	""good for America.""	""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 	for office,"" he said. ""We have free speech on our side.""	--------------080808010909060409040405--"

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire	privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.	Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock	and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of	eRoom.	Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom	makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,	Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.	Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration	Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its	tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,	according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.	With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in	real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even	jointly creating content.	Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but	workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even	simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.	For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own	content-management system through combined sales channels. Further	integration is planned down the line, the companies said."

He might have dreamed of becoming an	ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined	toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to	use the Internet to end world hunger.	But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring	different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do	something more social and more interesting than working with computers.	Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you	can't get the chicks with that anymore.""	The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of	some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech	come to a halt.	The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in	2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And	educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some	colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.	The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled	into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of	Computing Machinery.	""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic	declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering	at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at	some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far	exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""	At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science	department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington	University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer	science fell by more than half this year.	Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the	past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and	computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing	Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees	were awarded.	The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the	fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other	computer-related industries trailing close behind.	But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among	college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying	information technology and engineering at George Mason University were	computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is	down to 800, although a newly created and more general information	technology major has attracted 200 students.	""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,	dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.	""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four	years on something and then not get a job.""	Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major	is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland	decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does	not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of	Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.	""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their	interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a	factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect	to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no	longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""	Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not	convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,	with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his	advanced-placement exam in computer science.	""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,	so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak	said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I	want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""	Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of	America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,	salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.	""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the	same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this	kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry	is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the	road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to	find themselves in a shortage situation.""	Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other	factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social	influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional	development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception	of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in	the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during	the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.	""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet	as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that	came along.""	Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in	the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business	marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.	""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""	Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I	think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a	necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further."""

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH	worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to	have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on	again).	Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.

It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been	there all along.	Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.

If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 	typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man	definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an	anthrolopology professor's conclusions?

I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.	I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).	Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program.

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities	are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which	is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next	generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large	scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless	configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and	others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit	considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize	the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless	is tied into fiber at multiple points.	The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but	a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth	measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to	well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and	bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an	order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and	proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the	cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers	can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low	bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of	large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective	bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's	long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to	keep things sane.	Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,	especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the	system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more	efficient).	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com"

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?	There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL	FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think	most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That	pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,	you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to	accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""	But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers	that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to	get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?	That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but	then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how	SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP	transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is	going fine and has no reason to try new methods.	Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code	indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is	saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some	spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from	their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can	lower the incidence.	the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be	huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to	go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access	DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)	Crist J.

Greg	September 19, 2002	  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web	  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications	  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During	  and Between Online Meetings	  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for	  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network	  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure	  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors	  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx	  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time	  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced	  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P	  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class	  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.	  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this	  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around	  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience	  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how	  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between	  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple	  copies of constantly changing documents.	  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of	  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit	  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than	  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured	  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also	  essential.	  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for	  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be	  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be	  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules	  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at	  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,	  inside or outside company firewalls.	  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web	  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at	  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or	  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across	  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents	  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx	  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,	  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.	  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed	  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says	  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination	  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist	  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by	  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""	  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,	  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president	  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the	  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure	  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the	  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""	  About Magi	  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms	  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration	  network of files and web resources.

Even if you are	fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you	still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of	static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be	alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best	which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard	drives become cheaper.	Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term	significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static	application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large	client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because	these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different	sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also	tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular	with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence	services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a	physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application	server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I	use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable	because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap	space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)	My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID	device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image	partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but	solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of	base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the	server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then	market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that	rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer	overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized	modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this	particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend	application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself	has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could	help.	I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a	hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no	knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a	product, I'd love to hear about it.	Ben"

POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most	proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently	rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to	work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient	synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other	way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.	It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying	things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any	idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.	People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but	apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.	Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the	original stupid errors.	Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years	essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them	at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with	multiple threads or processes.

I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case	(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the	technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.	Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous	network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal	queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,	lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and	an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe	or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist	congregation is about as orthogonal to my present	congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist	politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist	bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I	used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.	I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I	show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a	civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing	with them. :-).	Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.	I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one	year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married	her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was	just looking to make friends as I was new in town.	The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation	you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some	guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can	practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a	room...	That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most	regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in	protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,	looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.	You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at	least better looking than you are. :-).

Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 	remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 	reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 	honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 	that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 	tilde. 	Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 	directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 	will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 	their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 	trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 	pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 	have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 	subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 	from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 	But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 	As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 	this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (	old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 	Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 	tilde. 	In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 	used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 	tilde in its URL. 	Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 	Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 	that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 	character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 	indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 	to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 	The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 	(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 	the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 	uses. 	Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 	#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 	1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 	meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 	SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 	what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 	when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 	And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 	yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 	Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 	pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary	[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 	cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 	ASCII characters. 	As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem	[11]. 	In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 	In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 	Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 	As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 	As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 	In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 	(history,tilde,job control)[16]. 	As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 	in the APL-11 character set[18]. 	In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 	bugs in csh). 	In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 	this typographical pun[21]. 	And that's the earliest reference I can find. 	So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 	there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 	tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 	&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 	to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 	sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 	my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 	May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls."

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more	to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the	gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't	the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it	was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to	the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the	people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't	support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin	Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that	this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a	right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the	folks they elected in the first place.	My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases	such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts	we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He	has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the	representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.	I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original	thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming	dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in	having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the	policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the	screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from	the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,	offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply	due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My	generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,	we just dont' know it all.	Screaming != Free speech on all cases.	Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by	the Supremes.	K?	Best regards,"

(To better 	understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 	except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 	line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 	regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 	un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 	add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 	Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 	reader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 	dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 	gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif 	...&#8221; And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home 	page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76)."

Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make	solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with	solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to	other unixen like HPUX and SCO.	 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One	of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your	hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,	they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software	problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.	 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There	is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,	though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.	 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,	who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,	that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a	cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.	John"

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups	of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell	money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as	(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the	patented bracing methods.

If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems	with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches,	think again.	The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we	make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,	all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different	Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.

According	to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,	shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.	The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of	anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the	University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit	people's shape.	The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the	inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below	the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.	It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)	taller than his French counterpart.	The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men	only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height	advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.	The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared	with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and	1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and	Americans 1,626.7mm	More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other	nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men	and 66.7 for women.	The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7	inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and	806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of	1,047.2mm.	The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second	largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably	smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.	The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than	the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the	Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively	outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.	However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm	compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,	compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.	The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the	available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm	longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American	average.	The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German	counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.	Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for	occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.

Sigma Designs [1] is a	company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,	divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very	gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to	put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.	Some notes from other places....	""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4	Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.	Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers	have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those	who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -	which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it	under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma	codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen	code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only	disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once	again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today	nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public	in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince	Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has	been resolved XviD development will not continue.	That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about	the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.	Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors	first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes	and kept quiet about the matter at hand.	[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of	the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.	However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release	makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we	might be hearing more about this.	[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it	also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD	doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides	with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before	downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd	fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with	Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX	compatible as it was advertised.	[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma	source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The	license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and	install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now	clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)	that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the	copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and	replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you	can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright	statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on	your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken	from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different	copyright notices which is quite funny."""

Instead you should collect all the information 	from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 	couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 	one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 	of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 	back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 	messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 	fail is not insignificant. 	Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 	after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 	Screenshot)] 	The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 	predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 	not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 	Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 	didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 	so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 	long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 	you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 	of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 	their system in an indeterminate state. 	In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 	in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 	the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 	And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 	reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 	keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 	part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 	don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 	code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 	call it at the right place. 	I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 	do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 	slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 	FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 	operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 	the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 	IIS to stop and start. 	*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 	has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 	your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 	arguments are unbelievably boring.  	Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 	definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 	certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 	in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 	an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 	is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 	search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 	find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 	know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 	Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 	costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 	productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 	I've been using for years to make wizards. 	*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 	programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 	- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 	life of the code. 	- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 	them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 	because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 	SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 	new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 	morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 	the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 	Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 	suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 	too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 	lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 	- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 	standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 	oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 	meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 	mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 	software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 	guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 	and say ""Aha!""	*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 	Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 	reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications."

I think most people on Fork probably have	more programming knowledge than I do... There's lots of experience out	here...	Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of	shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to	suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least	development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few	server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had	no problems with great performance.	Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad""	programming language or application platform?  You don't think this has	anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS has	basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?	Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the	right way to go for most high level applications?	Hmmm again.... You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took	you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak?  I am	not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really	good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory	management, however occasional they may be.	Wow!  So you're telling me that unless the application involves	bit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What about	high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't most	high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?	Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?  For	example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks	(there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating	system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?	I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the	case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large	applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more	than three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get the	programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  With	Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in	a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database	(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).	YIKES!  Have you written db code with C/C++ for different databases (just an	example)?  Tried porting a persistence layer from Windows to Unix?  Say you	have Informix running on Solaris and you want to port to Windows with MS SQL	(bad idea...but for the sake of the example), would you rather deal with	JDBC port or C/C++ port that uses Informix drivers and now you have to use	ODBC?	So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for	everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of	dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,	database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there is	one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim	ignorance...	Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is	overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace	to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no	flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious	discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every ""Kid""	can write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understand	various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually	tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and	reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++	than in Java due to existence of standard API's."

Thus, my book	methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.	Perhaps you	have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune	buggy, etc.). 	These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but	they	cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must	be	based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. 	In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks	on a	book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many	differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer	rather	directly. 	According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call	``the	three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,	which	Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in	turn. 	Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used	In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety	and the	issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language	design,	efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where	efficiency	considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming	Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing	time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was	programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's	implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed	for the	sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). 	Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we	are	not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as	programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are	reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now	turn. 	Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost	Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks	to	maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges	are	usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''	that	must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these	programmers work. 	Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,	the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost	of	computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the	increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of	program	maintenance compared to program development. 	manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some	way	by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether	it	comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by	novices	or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are	frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming	language. 	Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are	often	unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from	dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately	represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered	in	seeking an economical design. 	Elegance Symbolizes Good Design	``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the	critical	role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. 	For the Designer	It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the	difficulty	of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).	Structural	engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't	make	extensive use of computer models and calculation. 	One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which	variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this	decision is not	made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this	is	another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical	analysis	may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of	safety is	additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). 	Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a	choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an	over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. 	Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it	vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.	Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a	consequence of	an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed	the	Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided	by aesthetic principles. 	According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do	not	abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because	solutions to	structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible	solutions to a	particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention	to	designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are	unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. 	The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can	be	guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea	by	inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds	(p.	21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of	form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and	economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. 	The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the	interaction	of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our	aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having	to	check all the possible interactions. 	For the User	In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge	that	looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which	features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed	bridge	gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should	reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the	consequences	of our actions. 	We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to	sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the	outside.	So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation	of a	deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their	(unwarranted)	confidence. 	In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a	consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or	programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited	value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the	                                The Elegance Principle	              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. 	The Programming Language as Work Environment	There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming	language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable	and	safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that	take	place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? 	A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's	fatigue	and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,	encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a	natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging	the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming	language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. 	Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of	its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may	represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming	language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by	neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.	Out of	sight, out of mind. 	Acquiring a Sense of Elegance	Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined	sense	of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive	experience	in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.	Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each	competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public	also	critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along	with that of the designers. 	So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -	and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs	and try	to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''	comes	along.

I think that there are a couple	of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will	be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the	most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix	their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and	you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you	might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.	   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very	important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes	of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available	vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated	methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about	the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into	a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you	can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so	you can make and test predictions.	   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we	wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security	admin's job would be a lot harder.	Adam	| ---------- Forwarded message ----------	| On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,	| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills	| itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash	| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software	| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell	| anyone else.	| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a	| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.	| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research	| known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security	| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short	| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem	| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the	| vulnerability, if possible.  	| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by	| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible	| disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release	| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released	| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers	| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked	| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people	| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem	| was.	| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and	| exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible	| disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the	| underground, vulnerable.	| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known	| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to	| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,	| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and	| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less	| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see	| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so	| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as	| long as possible.	| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous	| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in	| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding	| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  	| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently	| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the	| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software	| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to	| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if	| HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this	| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the	| information.	| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,	| together, add up to a catastrophe.	| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to	| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,	| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime	| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.	| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will	| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be	| --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good	| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority	| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.	| I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the	| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's	| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets	| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the	| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when	| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.	| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site	| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some	| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.	| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability	| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to	| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that	| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who	| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.	| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as	| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR	| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in	| Samba, for example.	| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either	| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public	| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or	| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating	| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly	| increase the availability of that information to the people who can	| Let's not let that happen.	| Greetings,	| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability	| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance	| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.	| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following	| Q. How will it work?	| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish	| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number	|          * Pure love of security research	|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks	|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products	|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure	| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the	| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the	| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following	|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)	|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided	|          * The potential severity level for the information shared	|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other	|            software and hardware potentially affected	|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs	|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE	| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?	| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other	| entity.	| Q. Why are you launching this program?	| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions	| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More	| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the	| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is	| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the	| public at large are warned in a timely manner.	| Q. Who gets the credit?	| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or	| exploit information.	| Q. When can I contribute?	| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.	| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please	| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.	| Regards,	| Sunil James	| Technical Analyst	| iDEFENSE	| ""iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively	| monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and	| hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.	| The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline	| security professionals and network administrators with timely access to	| actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.	| iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines	| the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new	| software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.""

Cheers,	RAH	--- begin forwarded text	Bob,	This guy's an idiot.	I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864	of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules	each.  They weigh 125 kg.	You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked	maximizes that.	It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking	and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need	voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual	capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them	arranged in series to boost the voltage.	Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.	--- begin forwarded text	Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like	1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible	to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for	accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.	(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)	Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few	real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were	talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the	wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,	it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady	discharge curve.	But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not	the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those	you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole	atoms, not just electrons.

Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.	B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 	acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 	people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 	expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 	sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 	the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 	society.	C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 	aren't 'found in the wild'.	(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 	there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 	behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 	 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 	40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 	conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)	D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 	less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 	by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 	pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 	integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 	government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 	of British conquest, but who doesn't?)

The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 	nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.	In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 	Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 	violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 	the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 	sides.

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the	average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.	Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the	realm as the Loch Ness monster. 	""But it's not, they are really out there.""

The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 	But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in	sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 	""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 	'Trigger camera' 	The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including	photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 	But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public	that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 	A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,	will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 	take a picture of itself."" 	'Like dogs' 	The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the	wild, or their descendants. 	cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs.

The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.	Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title	(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there	are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in	for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get	all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a	request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and	nearly impossible...	We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -	which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have	serial numbers and barcodes.

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more	serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain	West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable	protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if	heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the	local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests	I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually	facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are	protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets	results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses	and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known	to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very	effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their	protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.	-James Rogers	 jamesr@best.com"

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the	Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We	celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation	of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.	Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.	Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that	Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive	transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist	progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the	deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of	citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and	the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the	United Nations.	The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the	pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there	is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected	European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits	to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where	elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an	appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,	whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,	the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of	the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired	by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice	regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member	governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.	European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of	complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact	that our republican system of government is not based on proportional	representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise	the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy	is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear	- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere	in the world.	On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent	newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be	restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade	or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it	exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because	the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of	the US literally fantastic.	At least, for now.	Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact	remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European	intellectual and political elite.	The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in	check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a	system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,	however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot	understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national	sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it	does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures	from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal	vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the	process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble	with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,	authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic	societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.	Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals	to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the	liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its	dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references	to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to	comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,	therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a	commitment to	constitutional rights.	None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or	cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in	favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while	their tolerance of our differences will fall.

Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta	Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.	They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending	too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her	clothes back on.	But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they	wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some	sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.	There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

Sun Nabs Storage Startup	By Clint Boulton	Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San	Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data	storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.	The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup	with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and	virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),	virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices	into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that	is managed from a central console.	Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes	of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after	scouting some 65 companies.	Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com	that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible	acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of	storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such	as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.	""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7	or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a	critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""	N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)	architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a	role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled	as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and	networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.	While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground	in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,	according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of	IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest	increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,	respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of	$411 million.	Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of	Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002."

Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 	improves my day immeasurably.	I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 	thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   	One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.	Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.	I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 	getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 	improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 	isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 	often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 	but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 	creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.	I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 	kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 	working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 	the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 	that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 	talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 	party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 	on the net all you have is a photo.....	You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 	not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.	(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)	It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 	ick!"" when you might have a great time together.	We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 	people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 	tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 	but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 	person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 	exposure shrinks after school.	Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 	work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 	doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 	same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.	An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating	Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 	the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 	it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 	project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.	It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 	people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 	and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 	though. 	I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 	you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 	actually sound.	Eirikur"

2428,spam,"	by zzzzason.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id F204B16F16		by localhost with IMAP (fetchmail-5.9.0)	Hi,	I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  	I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 	$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?	In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,	it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...	You've probably heard stories about people making	whopping huge money online, but you thought they 	were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or	boy-geniuses.	Well, grasshopper, think again ...	It's people like you and me that are making the real	money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!	Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time	entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 	companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.	Today small business owners and ordinary folks 	like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 	financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 	work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 	technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.	If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 	you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 	DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?	You might not want their product, but remember that 	thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 	percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 	makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 	guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 	review some numbers ...	If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few	dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one	auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a	couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand	over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN	SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY	at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000	emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.	ZERO!	Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when	hardly anyone sees your ad!	Imagine that you have a decent product with a 	profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 	an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 	in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 	generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 	of work.  	It's that simple ...	All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A	THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.	The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 	matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 	using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 	executive working from an office building in New 	York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 	bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 	it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 	and some basic familiarity with the Internet.	I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 	""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 	started with no money, no product to sell, and only 	the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 	opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 	I bought my own home - with CASH.  	You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.	You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience	whatsoever is required.  	If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that	you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.	So what are you waiting for?!	I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer	YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you	will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.	Here goes ...	Do you have basic experience with the web? 	Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?	Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  	Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 	complete financial freedom?  	If you answer YES to these questions, you could be	making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 	home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 	the 9-5 daily grind!	All you need is ambition and commitment.  This	is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work	to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 	it.	You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  	Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 	how to start your first email campaign and how to	build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 	orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.	Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?	No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot	products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay	starting an Internet business because they have 	nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  	After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 	product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 	not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 	seven days. In fact ...	I personally guarantee that you will start your own 	bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 	the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 	to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 	where else will you find that level of service?!	I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 	your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 	Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 	routine for you to follow with specific, exact 	instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 	example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 	The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 	list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 	very first campaign is ready to go.	As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 	of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 	email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even	include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE	if you order NOW!	Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 	classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 	never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 	on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  	What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 	to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 	you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 	extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 	Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  	I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a	** THE BULKBOOK	Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit	bulk emailer.

2450,spam,"       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.	       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.	        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.	        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.	        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.	        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.	        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.	        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 	        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.	         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 	         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.	         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.	          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.	And they expect you to listen to them?	Enough.	If you want to make money with your computer, then you should	hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making	a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will	show YOU how to do the same thing.	This business is done completely by internet and email, and you	can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send	an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.	How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.	We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.	But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 	insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,	and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if	you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be	just the thing you are looking for.	This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is	done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,	there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -	meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase	each month also).	Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a	free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you	decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still	have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward	them incredibly well, if they work at it.	To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 	 informtion	""Send me a free membership!""	1. First name	2. Last name	3. Email address (if different from above)	We will confirm your position and send you a special report	as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.	If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)	you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,	Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,	That's all there's to it.	We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.	Looking forward to hearing from you!	Sincerely, 	Hugh Zou	P.S. After having several negative experiences with network	marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed	that	you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to	intimidate me	or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the	KEREMA	local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.	MUNDI A.	KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul	Koromah	because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining	Corporation	of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 	instructed me	and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,	before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)	forces	intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children	and I	managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came	into	Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE	MILLION	UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited	with a	Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the	currier	company who will freight the money to your country.	Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in	your	country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the	future of	my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the	Trust	Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be	deposited	into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to	source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your	country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.	We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have	resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I	am being	monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice	you to	have the 	deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this	ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us	proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring	same into	your account.	Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private	discussions. 	Remain Blessed, 	MRS. ANNE  KOJO"

2476,spam,"       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.	       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.	        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.	        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.	        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.	        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.	        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.	        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 	        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.	         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 	         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.	         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.	          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.	          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?	Powered by List Builder"

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 	lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 	late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 	money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as	personal belongings and as such the security company does 	not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 	originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 	Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 	with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 	before he died of cardiac arrest.	As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 	an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 	consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 	affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 	to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 	consignment. You should know that this business is safety 	and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 	Terrorist fund.	If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 	me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 	expenses, and 75% for us.	You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 	name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 	that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 	also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 	of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 	consignment.	Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 	communication	Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 	requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 	(seven) working days.	I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 	Best regards, 	Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} 	Envoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis "

I am moved to write you this letter. 	This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 	Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation	till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over	(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State	Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim	of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and	stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of	confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and	confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where	the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.	Yours sincerely,	Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko."

Dear Sir,	 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 	On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.	Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 	On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 	According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.	 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 	This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 	There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 	Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.	 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 	Thanks and Regards,	 MR.VINCENT NNAJI."

2526,spam,"	by zzzzason.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id 2896916EFC		by localhost with IMAP (fetchmail-5.9.0)	It was the Spring of 1979.  	I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school	with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the	cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...	Stealing other kids' lunch money.	No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made	them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,	""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment	was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their	lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 	when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,	I promised to pay them even more the week after that,	if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 	longer.	Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school	started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,	and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 	things on their mind than last year's lunch money.	I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,	and I didn't even get beat up.	Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 	secrets you will ever learn.	First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not	going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when	you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 	grabbing the lifejacket.	Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.	They are looking out for their own money, not yours.	The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and	money managers, will always tell you that the best time to	buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep	your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.	Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is	""NEVER"".  	In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index	fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars	Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?	Hell no!	You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to	make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 	in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in	the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would	you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  	The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.	If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility	is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see	those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed	by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't	care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long	it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 	money.	What I'm talking about here is day trading.  	My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 	and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 	he makes money. 	The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a	$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 	advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 	certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 	down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  	I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 	amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 	only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.	Society would have you believe that successful trading is 	complicated and requires formal training.  	The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 	strategies to make money.  	Popular media and investment professionals portray successful	trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing	ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell	don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm	to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 	dollars.	1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 	person.	2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 	commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 	per trade.	Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,	positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...	The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact	so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend	a few hours of studying.  	After reading over 200 financial books and publications	during the past decade, and after using day trading	to successfully make more than four million dollars in	** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.	** Anyone can do it.	** It only takes a few hours to learn.	When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become	wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 	Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 	only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through	hard work, knowledge, and determination.	After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 	practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks	brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical	experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling	close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 	formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,	I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 	during those formative trading years I am willing to share	with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from	my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,	secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably	year after year.	The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 	hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within	minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 	and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 	5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year	22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year	35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 	27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 	11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 	After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 	profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 	you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 	win DESPITE the current market weakness. 	*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.	*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.	*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 	buy them and the exact price to sell them. 	*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 	mistakes beginners make.	*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 	consistently in every market! 	*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 	for great success. 	*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.	*** Make money on the biggest news stories.	*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum	returns. 	*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 	professionals use.	*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some	wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?	With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 	need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 	choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 	lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 	trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 	dollars.

If you are serious about success in short term stock 	trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your	own financial future.	Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?	His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 	make money in the stock market.  	Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California	coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.	In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading	is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking	for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 	that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't	your kind of game.

It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 	MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 	MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 	The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 	The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story.

If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 	With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 	I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period.

Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and	reputable person to handle a very confidential	transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge	sum of money to a foreign account. 	There were series of contracts executed by a 	consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in	favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 	contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum	of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 	United	State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and	is now ready to be transferred being that the	companies	that actually executed these contracts have been	fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 	Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 	transfer the total amount to your account for	subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants	are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil	service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 	accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust	reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 	return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 	transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for	incidental expenses (internal and external) between	both parties in the course of the transaction you will	be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts	in due course. 	Modalities have been worked out at the highest level	of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 	Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds	within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of	the above stated terms. 	Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 	accord this transaction the legality it deserves and	for mutual security of the funds the whole approval	procedures will officially and legally processed	with your name or the name of any company you may	nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 	Once more I want you to understand that having put	in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my	country, I am averse to having my image and career 	dented. This matter should therefore be treated with	utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 	Please you should signify your intention to assist	by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this	transaction, if favorable we will take further steps	to brief you the full details of this viable 	transaction. 	I want to assure you that this business proposal is	100% risk free as we have done our homework	properly. 	I quite believe that you will protect our interest	by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are	still in government service, which we intend to	retire from in full honor.	Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to	enable us include this transfer in the next batch	which would constitute the new quarter payments	for the 2002 financial year. 	Thank you and God bless.	Dr James Alabi"

Of course it does. You most likely have	just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).	And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -	New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when	she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried	beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old	sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when	she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,	fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.	""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old	woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my	husband earns in a year"".	The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where	he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away	and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did	they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than	actually finding it in the closet.	As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 	""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday	after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his	computer in his bedroom.	""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name	on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever	15-year-old.	The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one	$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top	and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to	the top of the list.	The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand	dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your	name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and	really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.	Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box	that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions	began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.	""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box	had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a	yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I	was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the	counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back	home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over	the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The	money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the	closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike	to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 	fifties and hundreds.	""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks	with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the	lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the	money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a	really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me	and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next	bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any	reason to be afraid.The reporting news 	team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was	sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was	completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,	Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in	the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which	state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.	Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,	""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter	legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 	five-dollar fee.	[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how	the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 	appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -	 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].	BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you	say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been	hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the	 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire	show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really	can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the	program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are	""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if	people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some	megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".	DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS	PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER	THAN EVER.	Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when	I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.	In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so	that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the	following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money	for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.	approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I	finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal	effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total	$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".	Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.	but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the	mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions	and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I	only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of	$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I	have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to	success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change	anything.""

Let's	also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response	could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people	will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).	Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.	With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10	people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.	Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals	100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.	Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.	The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.	Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million	e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.	Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of	50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school	with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the	cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...	Stealing other kids' lunch money.	No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made	them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,	""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment	was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their	lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 	when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,	I promised to pay them even more the week after that,	if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 	longer.	Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school	started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,	and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 	things on their mind than last year's lunch money.	I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,	and I didn't even get beat up.	Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 	secrets you will ever learn.	First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not	going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when	you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 	grabbing the lifejacket.	Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.	They are looking out for their own money, not yours.	The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and	money managers, will always tell you that the best time to	buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep	your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.	Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is	""NEVER"".  	In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index	fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars	Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?	Hell no!	You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to	make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 	in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in	the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would	you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  	The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.	If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility	is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see	those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed	by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't	care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long	it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 	money.	What I'm talking about here is day trading.  	My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 	and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 	he makes money. 	The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a	$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 	advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 	certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 	down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  	I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 	amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 	only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.	Society would have you believe that successful trading is 	complicated and requires formal training.  	The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 	strategies to make money.  	Popular media and investment professionals portray successful	trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing	ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell	don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm	to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 	dollars.	1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 	person.	2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 	commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 	per trade.	Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,	positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...	The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact	so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend	a few hours of studying.  	After reading over 200 financial books and publications	during the past decade, and after using day trading	to successfully make more than four million dollars in	** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.	** Anyone can do it.	** It only takes a few hours to learn.	When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become	wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 	Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 	only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through	hard work, knowledge, and determination.	After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 	practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks	brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical	experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling	close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 	formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,	I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 	during those formative trading years I am willing to share	with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from	my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,	secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably	year after year.	The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 	hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within	minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 	and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 	5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year	22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year	35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 	27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 	11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 	After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 	profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 	you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 	win DESPITE the current market weakness. 	*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.	*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.	*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 	buy them and the exact price to sell them. 	*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 	mistakes beginners make.	*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 	consistently in every market! 	*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 	for great success. 	*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.	*** Make money on the biggest news stories.	*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum	returns. 	*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 	professionals use.	*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.

WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)	Dear Sir, 	I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 	Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 	Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 	this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 	of both of us. 	The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 	lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 	late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 	money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as	personal belongings and as such the security company does 	not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 	originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 	Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 	with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 	before he died of cardiac arrest.	As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 	an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 	consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 	affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 	to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 	consignment. You should know that this business is safety 	and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 	Terrorist fund.	If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 	me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 	expenses, and 75% for us.	You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 	name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 	that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 	also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 	of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 	consignment.	Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 	communication	Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 	requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 	(seven) working days.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 	As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 	I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 	simply delete it. 	READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 	weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 	Believe it, work it. 	This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 	4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 	(money) 	started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 	try!! 	You will be glad you did. 	Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 	delete this!!! 	First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 	PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 	IN HIS CLOSET! 	Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 	You most likely have just seen this story recently 	featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 	And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 	of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 	and putting laundry away when she came across a large 	brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 	some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 	15-year-old sons closet. 	Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 	when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 	Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 	all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 	""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 	says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 	dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 	earns in a year"". 	The woman immediately called her husband at the 	car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 	had discovered. He came home right away and they 	drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 	Little did they suspect that where the money came from 	was more shocking than actually finding it in 	the closet. 	As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 	E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 	obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 	the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 	computer in his bedroom. 	""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 	heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 	and I started sending it out"", says the clever 	15-year-old. 	The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 	instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 	on the list, then delete the address at the top and 	move the others addresses down, and finally to add 	your name to the top of the list. 	The letter goes on to state that you would receive 	several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 	weeks if you sent out the letter with your 	name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 	E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 	going to work"", the boy continues. 	Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 	the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 	for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 	fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 	$5 bills. 	""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 	office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 	envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 	that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 	I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 	goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 	whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 	home and empty out my backpack because I could not 	carry it all"". 	Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 	out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 	just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 	barely had time for my homework"". He had also 	been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 	area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 	and hundreds. 	""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 	riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 	time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 	the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 	exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 	One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 	told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 	my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 	rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 	Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 	afraid. The reporting news team examined and 	investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 	sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 	at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 	US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 	1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 	in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 	Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 	must be exchanged for money received. 	Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 	little note that read, ""Please send me report number 	XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 	was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 	five-dollar fee. 	[This is the end of the media release. If you would 	like to understand how the system works and get your 	$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 	is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 	YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 	instructions]. 	THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 	You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 	home!! 	Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 	letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 	popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 	program 	recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 	described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 	also 	investigated whether or not the program was legal. 	Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 	Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 	the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 	$25 out of pocket cost''. 	DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 	PROGRAM HAS 	ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 	I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 	glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 	the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 	total 	$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 	Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 	=======Here is 	long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 	again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 	simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 	come 	in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 	made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 	the 	program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 	key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 	===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== 	If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 	and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 	AGAIN!!! 	FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 	DREAMS WILL COME 	TRUE, GUARANTEED! 	================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 	For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 	YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 	name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 	ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 	problems. 	=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 	reports. 	You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 	and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 	Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 	from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 	be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 	from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 	in case something happens to your computer. 	IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 	next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 	than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 	loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 	works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 	this 	method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 	have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 	could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 	have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 	anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 	work for you. 	Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 	1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 	and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 	This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 	their fortune. 	2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 	3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 	4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 	5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 	6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 	PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 	**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 	on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 	Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 	you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 	purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 	includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 	free 	classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 	Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 	we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 	Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 	response 	could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 	people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 	each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 	With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 	Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 	of 50,000. 	Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 	people responded and ordered Report # 2. 	Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 	e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 	Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 	million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 	for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 	total of 	50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 	orders for 	Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 	million). 	+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 	Total=$555,550.00 	NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 	WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 	CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 	MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 	REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 	OUT 	OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 	everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 	each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 	and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 	METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 	Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 	hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 	Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 	start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 	receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 	it. Always provide 	same day service on all orders. 	This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 	name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 	until they receive the report. 	===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 	send 	$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 	the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 	one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 	are ordering, 	YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

I am an 	accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 	money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 	''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 	the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 	totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 	with 	both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 	''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 	on me! 	Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 	had 	received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 	joined 	Jody in her ''hobby''. 	Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 	======= '' Not 	being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 	mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 	that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 	I 	wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 	surprised 	when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 	$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 	that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 	investment 	with a faster return and so big''. 	Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 	======= '' I had 	received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 	wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 	to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 	again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 	again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 	first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 	Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 	'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 	little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 	within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 	$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 	362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

2664,spam,"	by zzzzason.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id ED29B16F03		by localhost with IMAP (fetchmail-5.9.0)	Hi,	I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  	I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 	$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?	In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,	it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...	You've probably heard stories about people making	whopping huge money online, but you thought they 	were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or	boy-geniuses.	Well, grasshopper, think again ...	It's people like you and me that are making the real	money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!	Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time	entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 	companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.	Today small business owners and ordinary folks 	like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 	financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 	work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 	technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.	If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 	you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 	DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?	You might not want their product, but remember that 	thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 	percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 	makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 	guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 	review some numbers ...	If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few	dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one	auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a	couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand	over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN	SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY	at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000	emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.	ZERO!	Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when	hardly anyone sees your ad!	Imagine that you have a decent product with a 	profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 	an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 	in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 	generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 	of work.  	It's that simple ...	All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A	THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.	The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 	matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 	using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 	executive working from an office building in New 	York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 	bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 	it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 	and some basic familiarity with the Internet.	I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 	""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 	started with no money, no product to sell, and only 	the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 	opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 	I bought my own home - with CASH.  	You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.	You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience	whatsoever is required.  	If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that	you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.	So what are you waiting for?!	I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer	YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you	will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.	Here goes ...	Do you have basic experience with the web? 	Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?	Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  	Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 	complete financial freedom?  	If you answer YES to these questions, you could be	making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 	home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 	the 9-5 daily grind!	All you need is ambition and commitment.  This	is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work	to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 	it.	You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  	Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 	how to start your first email campaign and how to	build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 	orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.	Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?	No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot	products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay	starting an Internet business because they have 	nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  	After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 	product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 	not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 	seven days. In fact ...	I personally guarantee that you will start your own 	bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 	the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 	to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 	where else will you find that level of service?!	I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 	your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 	Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 	routine for you to follow with specific, exact 	instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 	example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 	The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 	list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 	very first campaign is ready to go.	As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 	of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 	email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even	include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE	if you order NOW!	Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 	classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 	never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 	on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  	What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 	to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 	you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 	extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook!

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I	represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief	security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the	person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the	advent of a new democratic	dispensation in the country under the leadership of	Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under	severe persecution due to the sensitive position he	held in the last military regime, presently he is	under house arrest restricted only to the confines of	his village.	The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a	business proposal that might be of interest to you. My	client has informed me of the existence of funds	deposited with a security company abroad. This fund	came about as part of security votes that were	allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure	as chief security adviser to the then president. What	happened was that he had part of the funds transferred	from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this	security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal	security outfit of the	then president. But before the purchase could take	place the president died. My client has decided to	keep this for himself as all his properties has been	confisticated by the present regime. But due to his	incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the	change of possession to his benefit.	I have been mandated by my client to source for a	foreign partner that can help him facilitate the	change of possession. The deposit certificate and the	code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in	my possession.	The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand	United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.	I remain most obliged.	Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  	Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila.

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 	I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 	Expecting your prompt response.

Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran	ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.	Thanks and regards. 	MR.IKE EJOH"

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 	lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 	late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 	money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as	personal belongings and as such the security company does 	not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 	originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 	Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 	with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 	before he died of cardiac arrest.	As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 	an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 	consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 	affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 	to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 	consignment. You should know that this business is safety 	and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 	Terrorist fund.	If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 	me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 	expenses, and 75% for us.	You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 	name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 	that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 	also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 	of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 	consignment.

I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.	I need those houses...	Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 	I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 	If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com 	Best Wishes, 	Jeremy Lessaris	847.366.4300	www.synteligent.com	jeremy@synteligent.com	with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message"

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This	is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 	dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange	and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 	and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the	Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 	the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of	Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 	his soul rest in peace. 	Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in	my country, I and some of my colleagues were 	instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and	ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 	Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel	group. We were then given this money privately 	by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other	Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 	was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we	were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 	immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here	in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 	said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and	seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 	(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military	Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 	President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President	Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 	In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who	can assist us to move this money out of my country 	as the beneficiary. 	WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic	Cover to a security company in Europe in your 	name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked	''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 	will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 	Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from	our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 	(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked	with the late President Kabila, immediately 	after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,	the information We gathered from an associate 	who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with	your sincere assistance, this transaction will 	be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two	weeks. The said money is a state fund and 	therefore requires a total confidentiality. 	We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this	fund in Europe. This is because we are under 	restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in	order not to lose this fund which we have worked 	so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out	of Congo, you can contact me through my email 	addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal	information to enable us discuss the 	modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU	SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC	OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,	THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.	I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS	GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF	CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY	AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN	MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER	DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO	CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS	DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER	FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW	HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE	ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER	EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S	TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE	MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO	STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,	LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON	TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S	CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE	FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY	IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND	CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION	UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A	SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE	SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM	KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO	INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR	BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON	(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I	WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY	REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL	COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND	NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT	EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH	THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY	THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN	CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL	PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU	WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND	ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.	FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT	INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX	NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO"

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school	with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the	cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...	Stealing other kids' lunch money.	No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made	them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,	""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment	was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their	lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 	when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,	I promised to pay them even more the week after that,	if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 	longer.	Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school	started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,	and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 	things on their mind than last year's lunch money.	I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,	and I didn't even get beat up.	Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 	secrets you will ever learn.	First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not	going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when	you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 	grabbing the lifejacket.	Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.	They are looking out for their own money, not yours.	The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and	money managers, will always tell you that the best time to	buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep	your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.	Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is	""NEVER"".  	In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index	fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars	Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?	Hell no!	You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to	make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 	in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in	the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would	you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  	The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.	If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility	is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see	those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed	by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't	care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long	it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 	money.	What I'm talking about here is day trading.  	My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 	and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 	he makes money. 	The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a	$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 	advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 	certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 	down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  	I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 	amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 	only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.	Society would have you believe that successful trading is 	complicated and requires formal training.  	The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 	strategies to make money.  	Popular media and investment professionals portray successful	trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing	ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell	don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm	to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 	dollars.	1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 	person.	2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 	commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 	per trade.	Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,	positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...	The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact	so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend	a few hours of studying.  	After reading over 200 financial books and publications	during the past decade, and after using day trading	to successfully make more than four million dollars in	** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.	** Anyone can do it.	** It only takes a few hours to learn.	When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become	wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 	Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 	only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through	hard work, knowledge, and determination.	After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 	practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks	brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical	experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling	close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 	formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,	I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 	during those formative trading years I am willing to share	with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from	my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,	secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably	year after year.	The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 	hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within	minutes.

His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 	make money in the stock market.  	Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California	coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.	In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading	is the fastest track to wealth.

I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji	Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security	advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the	person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 	With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under	the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under	severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last	military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to	the confines of his village.	The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal	that might be of interest to you. My	client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a	security company abroad. This fund	came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's	portfolio during his tenure	as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that	he had part of the funds transferred	from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit	with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal	security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could	take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for	himself as all his properties has been	confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he	cannot travel out and effect the	change of possession to his benefit.	I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that	can help him facilitate the	change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for	the execution of this endeavour are in	my possession.	The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred	Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of	interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we	can go 	through the rudiments of this endeavour.	I remain most obliged.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.	And they expect you to listen to them?	Enough.	If you want to make money with your computer, then you should	hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making	a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will	show YOU how to do the same thing.	This business is done completely by internet and email, and you	can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send	an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.	How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.	We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.	But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 	insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,	and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if	you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be	just the thing you are looking for.	This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is	done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,	there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -	meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase	each month also).	Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a	free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you	decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still	have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward	them incredibly well, if they work at it.	To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 	 information	""Send me a free membership!""	1. First name	2. Last name	3. Email address (if different from above)	We will confirm your position and send you a special report	as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.	If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)	you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,	Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,	That's all there's to it.	We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.	Looking forward to hearing from you!	Sincerely, 	Hugh Zou	P.S. After having several negative experiences with network	marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.	This is different - there is value, integrity, and a	REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...	and finally make real money on the internet.

My Dear ,	Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.	My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !	confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.	During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!	 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.	Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;	1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.	2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 	Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.	Best Regards, 	Mr.Michael Kamah and family. "
